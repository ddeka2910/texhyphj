AD­VEN­TURE I. A S­CAN­DAL IN BO­HEMI­A

I.

To Sher­lock Holmes she is al­ways THE wom­an. I have sel­dom heard
him men­tion her un­der any oth­er name. In his eye­s she e­clipses
and pre­dom­i­nates the w­hole of her sex. It was not that he felt
any e­mo­tion akin to love for Irene Adler. Al­l e­mo­tion­s, and that
one par­tic­u­lar­ly, were ab­hor­ren­t to his cold, pre­cise but
ad­mirably bal­anced mind. He was, I take it, the most per­fec­t
rea­son­ing and ob­serv­ing ma­chine that the world has seen, but as a
lover he would have placed him­self in a false po­si­tion. He n­ev­er
spoke of the soft­er pas­sion­s, save with a gibe and a s­neer. They
were ad­mirable things for the ob­serv­er-​-​ex­cel­len­t for draw­ing the
veil from men's mo­tives and ac­tion­s. But for the trained rea­son­er
to ad­mit such in­tru­sion­s in­to his own del­i­cate and fine­ly
ad­just­ed tem­pera­men­t was to in­tro­duce a dis­tract­ing fac­tor which
might throw a doubt up­on al­l his men­tal re­sult­s. Grit in a
sen­si­tive in­stru­men­t, or a crack in one of his own high-​pow­er
lens­es, would not be more dis­turb­ing than a strong e­mo­tion in a
na­ture such as his. And yet there was but one wom­an to him, and
that wom­an was the late Irene Adler, of du­bi­ous and ques­tion­able
mem­o­ry.

I had seen lit­tle of Holmes late­ly. My mar­riage had drift­ed us
away from each oth­er. My own com­plete hap­pi­ness, and the
home-​cen­tred in­ter­est­s which rise up around the man who first
find­s him­self mas­ter of his own es­tab­lish­men­t, were suf­fi­cien­t to
ab­sorb al­l my at­ten­tion, while Holmes, who loathed every for­m of
so­ci­ety with his w­hole Bo­hemi­an soul, re­mained in our lodg­ings in
Bak­er Street, buried a­mong his old book­s, and al­ter­nat­ing from
week to week be­tween co­caine and am­bi­tion, the drowsi­ness of the
drug, and the fierce en­er­gy of his own keen na­ture. He was stil­l,
as ever, deeply at­tract­ed by the s­tudy of crime, and oc­cu­pied his
im­mense fac­ul­ties and ex­tra­or­di­nary pow­er­s of ob­ser­va­tion in
fol­low­ing out those clues, and clear­ing up those mys­ter­ies which
had been a­ban­doned as hope­less by the of­fi­cial po­lice. From time
to time I heard some vague ac­coun­t of his do­ings: of his sum­mon­s
to Odessa in the case of the Tre­pof­f mur­der, of his clear­ing up
of the sin­gu­lar tragedy of the Atkin­son broth­er­s at Trin­co­ma­lee,
and fi­nal­ly of the mis­sion which he had ac­com­plished so
del­i­cate­ly and suc­cess­ful­ly for the reign­ing fam­i­ly of Hol­land.
Be­yond these sign­s of his ac­tiv­i­ty, how­ev­er, which I mere­ly
shared with al­l the read­er­s of the dai­ly press, I knew lit­tle of
my for­mer friend and com­pan­ion.

One night-​-​it was on the twen­ti­eth of March, 1888-​-​I was
re­turn­ing from a jour­ney to a pa­tien­t (for I had now re­turned to
civ­il prac­tice), when my way led me through Bak­er Street. As I
passed the well-​re­mem­bered door, which must al­ways be as­so­ci­at­ed
in my mind with my woo­ing, and with the dark in­ci­dents of the
S­tudy in S­car­let, I was seized with a keen de­sire to see Holmes
a­gain, and to know how he was em­ploy­ing his ex­tra­or­di­nary pow­er­s.
His room­s were bril­liant­ly lit, and, even as I looked up, I saw
his tal­l, s­pare fig­ure pass twice in a dark sil­hou­ette a­gainst
the blind. He was pac­ing the room swift­ly, ea­ger­ly, with his head
sunk up­on his chest and his hand­s clasped be­hind him. To me, who
knew his every mood and habit, his at­ti­tude and man­ner told their
own s­to­ry. He was at work a­gain. He had risen out of his
drug-​cre­at­ed dream­s and was hot up­on the s­cen­t of some new
prob­lem. I rang the bel­l and was shown up to the cham­ber which
had for­mer­ly been in part my own.

His man­ner was not ef­fu­sive. It sel­dom was; but he was glad, I
think, to see me. With hard­ly a word spo­ken, but with a kind­ly
eye, he waved me to an arm­chair, threw across his case of cigars,
and in­di­cat­ed a spir­it case and a gaso­gene in the cor­ner. Then he
s­tood be­fore the fire and looked me over in his sin­gu­lar
in­tro­spec­tive fash­ion.

"Wed­lock suit­s y­ou," he re­marked. "I think, Wat­son, that y­ou have
put on sev­en and a half pound­s s­ince I saw y­ou."

"Sev­en!" I an­swered.

"In­deed, I should have thought a lit­tle more. Just a tri­fle more,
I fan­cy, Wat­son. And in prac­tice a­gain, I ob­serve. Y­ou did not
tel­l me that y­ou in­tend­ed to go in­to har­ness."

"Then, how do y­ou know?"

"I see it, I d­e­duce it. How do I know that y­ou have been get­ting
y­our­self very wet late­ly, and that y­ou have a most clum­sy and
care­less ser­van­t girl?"

"My dear Holmes," said I, "this is too much. Y­ou would cer­tain­ly
have been burned, had y­ou lived a few cen­turies a­go. It is true
that I had a coun­try walk on Thurs­day and came home in a dread­ful
mess, but as I have changed my clothes I can't imag­ine how y­ou
d­e­duce it. As to Mary Jane, she is in­cor­ri­gi­ble, and my wife has
giv­en her no­tice, but there, a­gain, I fail to see how y­ou work it
out."

He chuck­led to him­self and rubbed his long, n­er­vous hand­s
to­geth­er.

"It is sim­plic­i­ty it­self," said he; "my eye­s tel­l me that on the
in­sid­e of y­our left shoe, just where the fire­light strikes it,
the leather is s­cored by six al­most par­al­lel cut­s. Ob­vi­ous­ly they
have been caused by some­one who has very care­less­ly scraped round
the edges of the sole in or­der to re­move crust­ed mud from it.
Hence, y­ou see, my dou­ble d­e­duc­tion that y­ou had been out in vile
weath­er, and that y­ou had a par­tic­u­lar­ly ma­lig­nan­t boot-​s­lit­ting
spec­i­men of the Lon­don slavey. As to y­our prac­tice, if a
gen­tle­man walk­s in­to my room­s s­melling of iod­ofor­m, with a black
mark of ni­trate of sil­ver up­on his right fore­fin­ger, and a bulge
on the right side of his top-​hat to show where he has se­cret­ed
his stetho­scope, I must be dul­l, in­deed, if I do not pro­nounce
him to be an ac­tive mem­ber of the med­ical pro­fes­sion."

I could not help laugh­ing at the ease with which he ex­plained his
process of d­e­duc­tion. "When I hear y­ou give y­our rea­son­s," I
re­marked, "the thing al­ways ap­pears to me to be so ridicu­lous­ly
sim­ple that I could eas­i­ly do it my­self, though at each
suc­ces­sive in­stance of y­our rea­son­ing I am baf­fled un­til y­ou
ex­plain y­our process. And yet I be­lieve that my eye­s are as good
as y­ours."

"Quite so," he an­swered, light­ing a ciga­rette, and throw­ing
him­self down in­to an arm­chair. "Y­ou see, but y­ou do not ob­serve.
The dis­tinc­tion is clear. For ex­am­ple, y­ou have fre­quent­ly seen
the step­s which lead up from the hal­l to this room."

"Fre­quent­ly."

"How of­ten?"

"Well, some hun­dred­s of times."

"Then how many are there?"

"How many? I don't know."

"Quite so! Y­ou have not ob­served. And yet y­ou have seen. That is
just my point. Now, I know that there are sev­en­teen step­s,
be­cause I have both seen and ob­served. By-​the-​way, s­ince y­ou are
in­ter­est­ed in these lit­tle prob­lem­s, and s­ince y­ou are good
e­nough to chron­i­cle one or t­wo of my tri­fling ex­pe­ri­ences, y­ou
may be in­ter­est­ed in this." He threw over a sheet of thick,
pink-​t­int­ed note-​pa­per which had been ly­ing open up­on the ta­ble.
"It came by the last post," said he. "Read it aloud."

The note was un­dat­ed, and with­out ei­ther sig­na­ture or ad­dress.

"There will cal­l up­on y­ou to-​night, at a quar­ter to eight
o'clock," it said, "a gen­tle­man who de­sires to con­sult y­ou up­on a
mat­ter of the very deep­est mo­men­t. Y­our re­cen­t ser­vices to one of
the roy­al hous­es of Eu­rope have shown that y­ou are one who may
safe­ly be trust­ed with mat­ter­s which are of an im­por­tance which
can hard­ly be ex­ag­ger­at­ed. This ac­coun­t of y­ou we have from al­l
quar­ter­s re­ceived. Be in y­our cham­ber then at that hour, and do
not take it amis­s if y­our vis­i­tor wear a mask."

"This is in­deed a mys­tery," I re­marked. "What do y­ou imag­ine that
it mean­s?"

"I have no da­ta yet. It is a cap­i­tal mis­take to the­o­rize be­fore
one has da­ta. In­sen­si­bly one be­gin­s to twist fact­s to suit
the­o­ries, in­stead of the­o­ries to suit fact­s. But the note it­self.
What do y­ou d­e­duce from it?"

I care­ful­ly ex­am­ined the writ­ing, and the pa­per up­on which it was
writ­ten.

"The man who wrote it was pre­sum­ably well to do," I re­marked,
en­deav­our­ing to im­i­tate my com­pan­ion's process­es. "Such pa­per
could not be bought un­der half a crown a pack­et. It is pe­cu­liar­ly
strong and s­tiff."

"Pe­cu­liar-​-​that is the very word," said Holmes. "It is not an
Eng­lish pa­per at al­l. Hold it up to the light."

I did so, and saw a large "E" with a s­mal­l "g," a "P," and a
large "G" with a s­mal­l "t" wo­ven in­to the tex­ture of the pa­per.

"What do y­ou make of that?" asked Holmes.

"The name of the mak­er, no doubt; or his mono­gram, rather."

"Not at al­l. The 'G' with the s­mal­l 't' s­tand­s for
'Gesellschaft,' which is the Ger­man for 'Com­pa­ny.' It is a
cus­tom­ary con­trac­tion like our 'Co.' 'P,' of course, s­tand­s for
'Pa­pi­er.' Now for the 'Eg.' Let us glance at our Con­ti­nen­tal
Gazetteer." He took down a heavy brown vol­ume from his shelves.
"E­glow, E­glonitz-​-​here we are, E­gri­a. It is in a Ger­man-​s­peak­ing
coun­try-​-​in Bo­hemi­a, not far from Carls­bad. 'Re­mark­able as be­ing
the scene of the death of Wal­len­stein, and for it­s nu­mer­ous
glass-​fac­to­ries and pa­per-​mill­s.' Ha, ha, my boy, what do y­ou
make of that?" His eye­s s­parkled, and he sen­t up a great blue
tri­umphan­t cloud from his ciga­rette.

"The pa­per was made in Bo­hemi­a," I said.

"Pre­cise­ly. And the man who wrote the note is a Ger­man. Do y­ou
note the pe­cu­liar con­struc­tion of the sen­tence-​-​'This ac­coun­t of
y­ou we have from al­l quar­ter­s re­ceived.' A French­man or Russian
could not have writ­ten that. It is the Ger­man who is so
un­cour­te­ous to his verb­s. It on­ly re­main­s, there­fore, to dis­cov­er
what is want­ed by this Ger­man who writes up­on Bo­hemi­an pa­per and
prefer­s wear­ing a mask to show­ing his face. And here he comes, if
I am not mis­tak­en, to re­solve al­l our doubt­s."

As he spoke there was the sharp sound of hors­es' hoof­s and
grat­ing wheel­s a­gainst the cur­b, fol­lowed by a sharp pul­l at the
bel­l. Holmes whis­tled.

"A pair, by the sound," said he. "Yes," he con­tin­ued, glanc­ing
out of the win­dow. "A nice lit­tle brougham and a pair of
beau­ties. A hun­dred and fifty guineas a­piece. There's mon­ey in
this case, Wat­son, if there is noth­ing else."

"I think that I had bet­ter go, Holmes."

"Not a bit, Doc­tor. S­tay where y­ou are. I am lost with­out my
Boswell. And this promis­es to be in­ter­est­ing. It would be a pity
to mis­s it."

"But y­our clien­t-​-​"

"N­ev­er mind him. I may wan­t y­our help, and so may he. Here he
comes. Sit down in that arm­chair, Doc­tor, and give us y­our best
at­ten­tion."

A s­low and heavy step, which had been heard up­on the s­tairs and
in the pas­sage, paused im­me­di­ate­ly out­side the door. Then there
was a loud and au­thor­i­ta­tive tap.

"Come in!" said Holmes.

A man en­tered who could hard­ly have been less than six feet six
inch­es in height, with the chest and limb­s of a Her­cules. His
dress was rich with a rich­ness which would, in Eng­land, be looked
up­on as akin to bad taste. Heavy band­s of as­trakhan were s­lashed
across the sleeves and fronts of his dou­ble-​breast­ed coat, while
the deep blue cloak which was thrown over his shoul­der­s was lined
with flame-​coloured silk and se­cured at the neck with a brooch
which con­sist­ed of a s­in­gle flam­ing beryl. Boot­s which ex­tend­ed
halfway up his calves, and which were trimmed at the top­s with
rich brown fur, com­plet­ed the im­pres­sion of bar­bar­ic op­u­lence
which was sug­gest­ed by his w­hole ap­pear­ance. He car­ried a
broad-​brimmed hat in his hand, while he wore across the up­per
part of his face, ex­tend­ing down past the cheek­bones, a black
vizard mask, which he had ap­par­ent­ly ad­just­ed that very mo­men­t,
for his hand was stil­l raised to it as he en­tered. From the low­er
part of the face he ap­peared to be a man of strong char­ac­ter,
with a thick, hang­ing lip, and a long, s­traight chin sug­ges­tive
of res­o­lu­tion pushed to the length of ob­sti­na­cy.

"Y­ou had my note?" he asked with a deep harsh voice and a
strong­ly marked Ger­man ac­cen­t. "I told y­ou that I would cal­l." He
looked from one to the oth­er of us, as if un­cer­tain which to
ad­dress.

"Pray take a seat," said Holmes. "This is my friend and
col­league, Dr. Wat­son, who is oc­ca­sion­al­ly good e­nough to help me
in my cas­es. Whom have I the ho­n­our to ad­dress?"

"Y­ou may ad­dress me as the Coun­t Von Kram­m, a Bo­hemi­an no­ble­man.
I un­der­stand that this gen­tle­man, y­our friend, is a man of ho­n­our
and dis­cre­tion, whom I may trust with a mat­ter of the most
ex­treme im­por­tance. If not, I should much pre­fer to com­mu­ni­cate
with y­ou alone."

I rose to go, but Holmes caugh­t me by the wrist and pushed me
back in­to my chair. "It is both, or none," said he. "Y­ou may say
be­fore this gen­tle­man any­thing which y­ou may say to me."

The Coun­t shrugged his broad shoul­der­s. "Then I must be­gin," said
he, "by bind­ing y­ou both to ab­solute se­cre­cy for t­wo years; at
the end of that time the mat­ter will be of no im­por­tance. At
present it is not too much to say that it is of such weight it
may have an in­flu­ence up­on Eu­ro­pean his­to­ry."

"I promise," said Holmes.

"And I."

"Y­ou will ex­cuse this mask," con­tin­ued our s­trange vis­i­tor. "The
au­gust per­son who em­ploys me wish­es his a­gen­t to be un­known to
y­ou, and I may con­fess at once that the ti­tle by which I have
just called my­self is not ex­act­ly my own."

"I was aware of it," said Holmes dry­ly.

"The cir­cum­stances are of great del­i­ca­cy, and every pre­cau­tion
has to be tak­en to quench what might grow to be an im­mense
s­can­dal and se­ri­ous­ly com­pro­mise one of the reign­ing fam­i­lies of
Eu­rope. To s­peak plain­ly, the mat­ter im­pli­cates the great House
of Orm­stein, hered­i­tary k­ings of Bo­hemi­a."

"I was al­so aware of that," mur­mured Holmes, set­tling him­self
down in his arm­chair and clos­ing his eye­s.

Our vis­i­tor glanced with some ap­par­en­t sur­prise at the lan­guid,
loung­ing fig­ure of the man who had been no doubt de­pict­ed to him
as the most in­ci­sive rea­son­er and most en­er­get­ic a­gen­t in Eu­rope.
Holmes s­low­ly re­opened his eye­s and looked im­pa­tient­ly at his
gi­gan­tic clien­t.

"If y­our Majesty would con­de­scend to s­tate y­our case," he
re­marked, "I should be bet­ter able to ad­vise y­ou."

The man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in
un­con­trol­lable ag­i­ta­tion. Then, with a ges­ture of des­per­a­tion, he
tore the mask from his face and hurled it up­on the ground. "Y­ou
are right," he cried; "I am the K­ing. Why should I at­temp­t to
con­ceal it?"

"Why, in­deed?" mur­mured Holmes. "Y­our Majesty had not spo­ken
be­fore I was aware that I was ad­dress­ing Wil­helm Gottsre­ich
Sigis­mond von Orm­stein, Grand Duke of Cas­sel-​Fel­stein, and
hered­i­tary K­ing of Bo­hemi­a."

"But y­ou can un­der­stand," said our s­trange vis­i­tor, sit­ting down
once more and pass­ing his hand over his high white fore­head, "y­ou
can un­der­stand that I am not ac­cus­tomed to do­ing such busi­ness in
my own per­son. Yet the mat­ter was so del­i­cate that I could not
con­fide it to an a­gen­t with­out putting my­self in his pow­er. I
have come incog­ni­to from Prague for the pur­pose of con­sult­ing
y­ou."

"Then, pray con­sult," said Holmes, shut­ting his eye­s once more.

"The fact­s are briefly these: Some five years a­go, dur­ing a
length­y vis­it to War­saw, I made the ac­quain­tance of the well-​known
ad­ven­turess, Irene Adler. The name is no doubt fa­mil­iar to y­ou."

"Kind­ly look her up in my in­dex, Doc­tor," mur­mured Holmes with­out
open­ing his eye­s. For many years he had adopt­ed a sys­tem of
dock­et­ing al­l para­graph­s con­cern­ing men and things, so that it
was d­if­fi­cult to name a sub­jec­t or a per­son on which he could not
at once fur­nish in­for­ma­tion. In this case I found her bi­og­ra­phy
sand­wiched in be­tween that of a He­brew rab­bi and that of a
staff-​com­man­der who had writ­ten a mono­graph up­on the deep-​sea
fish­es.

"Let me see!" said Holmes. "Hum! Born in New Jer­sey in the year
1858. Con­tral­to-​-​hum! La S­cala, hum! Pri­ma don­na Im­pe­r­i­al Oper­a
of War­saw-​-​yes! Re­tired from op­er­at­ic stage-​-​ha! Liv­ing in
Lon­don-​-​quite so! Y­our Majesty, as I un­der­stand, be­came en­tan­gled
with this y­oung per­son, wrote her some com­pro­mis­ing let­ter­s, and
is now de­sirous of get­ting those let­ter­s back."

"Pre­cise­ly so. But how-​-​"

"Was there a se­cret mar­riage?"

"None."

"No le­gal pa­per­s or cer­tifi­cates?"

"None."

"Then I fail to fol­low y­our Majesty. If this y­oung per­son should
pro­duce her let­ter­s for black­mail­ing or oth­er pur­pos­es, how is
she to prove their au­then­tic­i­ty?"

"There is the writ­ing."

"Pooh, pooh! Forgery."

"My pri­vate note-​pa­per."

"S­tolen."

"My own seal."

"Im­i­tat­ed."

"My pho­to­graph."

"Bought."

"We were both in the pho­to­graph."

"O­h, dear! That is very bad! Y­our Majesty has in­deed com­mit­ted an
in­dis­cre­tion."

"I was mad-​-​in­sane."

"Y­ou have com­pro­mised y­our­self se­ri­ous­ly."

"I was on­ly Crown Prince then. I was y­oung. I am but thir­ty now."

"It must be re­cov­ered."

"We have tried and failed."

"Y­our Majesty must pay. It must be bought."

"She will not sel­l."

"S­tolen, then."

"Five at­tempt­s have been made. Twice bur­glars in my pay ran­sacked
her house. Once we di­vert­ed her lug­gage when she trav­elled. Twice
she has been way­laid. There has been no re­sult."

"No sign of it?"

"Ab­solute­ly none."

Holmes laughed. "It is quite a pret­ty lit­tle prob­lem," said he.

"But a very se­ri­ous one to me," re­turned the K­ing re­proach­ful­ly.

"Very, in­deed. And what does she pro­pose to do with the
pho­to­graph?"

"To ru­in me."

"But how?"

"I am about to be mar­ried."

"So I have heard."

"To Clotilde Loth­man von Sax­e-​Menin­gen, sec­ond daugh­ter of the
K­ing of S­can­di­navi­a. Y­ou may know the stric­t prin­ci­ples of her
fam­i­ly. She is her­self the very soul of del­i­ca­cy. A shad­ow of a
doubt as to my con­duc­t would bring the mat­ter to an end."

"And Irene Adler?"

"Threat­en­s to send them the pho­to­graph. And she will do it. I
know that she will do it. Y­ou do not know her, but she has a soul
of s­teel. She has the face of the most beau­ti­ful of wom­en, and
the mind of the most res­olute of men. Rather than I should mar­ry
an­oth­er wom­an, there are no length­s to which she would not
go-​-​none."

"Y­ou are sure that she has not sen­t it yet?"

"I am sure."

"And why?"

"Be­cause she has said that she would send it on the day when the
be­trothal was pub­licly pro­claimed. That will be nex­t Mon­day."

"O­h, then we have three days yet," said Holmes with a yawn. "That
is very for­tu­nate, as I have one or t­wo mat­ter­s of im­por­tance to
look in­to just at present. Y­our Majesty will, of course, s­tay in
Lon­don for the present?"

"Cer­tain­ly. Y­ou will find me at the Lang­ham un­der the name of the
Coun­t Von Kram­m."

"Then I shal­l drop y­ou a line to let y­ou know how we progress."

"Pray do so. I shal­l be al­l anx­i­ety."

"Then, as to mon­ey?"

"Y­ou have carte blanche."

"Ab­solute­ly?"

"I tel­l y­ou that I would give one of the provinces of my k­ing­dom
to have that pho­to­graph."

"And for present ex­pens­es?"

The K­ing took a heavy chamois leather bag from un­der his cloak
and laid it on the ta­ble.

"There are three hun­dred pound­s in gold and sev­en hun­dred in
notes," he said.

Holmes scrib­bled a re­ceip­t up­on a sheet of his note-​book and
hand­ed it to him.

"And Made­moi­selle's ad­dress?" he asked.

"Is Briony Lodge, Ser­pen­tine Av­enue, St. John's Wood."

Holmes took a note of it. "One oth­er ques­tion," said he. "Was the
pho­to­graph a cab­i­net?"

"It was."

"Then, good-​night, y­our Majesty, and I trust that we shal­l soon
have some good news for y­ou. And good-​night, Wat­son," he added,
as the wheel­s of the roy­al brougham rolled down the street. "If
y­ou will be good e­nough to cal­l to-​mor­row af­ter­noon at three
o'clock I should like to chat this lit­tle mat­ter over with y­ou."


I­I.

At three o'clock pre­cise­ly I was at Bak­er Street, but Holmes had
not yet re­turned. The land­la­dy in­formed me that he had left the
house short­ly af­ter eight o'clock in the morn­ing. I sat down
be­side the fire, how­ev­er, with the in­ten­tion of await­ing him,
how­ev­er long he might be. I was al­ready deeply in­ter­est­ed in his
in­quiry, for, though it was sur­round­ed by none of the grim and
s­trange fea­tures which were as­so­ci­at­ed with the t­wo crimes which
I have al­ready record­ed, stil­l, the na­ture of the case and the
ex­alt­ed s­ta­tion of his clien­t gave it a char­ac­ter of it­s own.
In­deed, a­part from the na­ture of the in­ves­ti­ga­tion which my
friend had on hand, there was some­thing in his mas­ter­ly grasp of
a sit­u­a­tion, and his keen, in­ci­sive rea­son­ing, which made it a
plea­sure to me to s­tudy his sys­tem of work, and to fol­low the
quick, sub­tle meth­od­s by which he dis­en­tan­gled the most
in­ex­tri­ca­ble mys­ter­ies. So ac­cus­tomed was I to his in­vari­able
suc­cess that the very pos­si­bil­i­ty of his fail­ing had ceased to
en­ter in­to my head.

It was close up­on four be­fore the door opened, and a
drunk­en-​look­ing groom, il­l-​kemp­t and side-​whiskered, with an
in­flamed face and dis­rep­utable clothes, walked in­to the room.
Ac­cus­tomed as I was to my friend's a­maz­ing pow­er­s in the use of
dis­guis­es, I had to look three times be­fore I was cer­tain that it
was in­deed he. With a n­od he van­ished in­to the bed­room, whence he
e­merged in five minutes tweed-​suit­ed and re­spectable, as of old.
Putting his hand­s in­to his pock­et­s, he stretch­ed out his legs in
fron­t of the fire and laughed hearti­ly for some minutes.

"Well, re­al­ly!" he cried, and then he choked and laughed a­gain
un­til he was oblig­ed to lie back, limp and help­less, in the
chair.

"What is it?"

"It's quite too fun­ny. I am sure y­ou could n­ev­er guess how I
em­ployed my morn­ing, or what I end­ed by do­ing."

"I can't imag­ine. I sup­pose that y­ou have been watch­ing the
habit­s, and per­hap­s the house, of Mis­s Irene Adler."

"Quite so; but the se­quel was rather un­usu­al. I will tel­l y­ou,
how­ev­er. I left the house a lit­tle af­ter eight o'clock this
morn­ing in the char­ac­ter of a groom out of work. There is a
won­der­ful sym­pa­thy and freema­son­ry a­mong horsey men. Be one of
them, and y­ou will know al­l that there is to know. I soon found
Briony Lodge. It is a bi­jou vil­la, with a gar­den at the back, but
built out in fron­t right up to the road, t­wo s­to­ries. Chub­b lock
to the door. Large sit­ting-​room on the right side, well
fur­nished, with long win­dows al­most to the floor, and those
pre­pos­ter­ous Eng­lish win­dow fas­ten­er­s which a child could open.
Be­hind there was noth­ing re­mark­able, save that the pas­sage win­dow
could be reached from the top of the coach-​house. I walked round
it and ex­am­ined it close­ly from every point of view, but with­out
not­ing any­thing else of in­ter­est.

"I then lounged down the street and found, as I ex­pect­ed, that
there was a mews in a lane which run­s down by one wal­l of the
gar­den. I lent the ostler­s a hand in rub­bing down their hors­es,
and re­ceived in ex­change t­wopence, a glass of half and half, t­wo
fill­s of shag to­bac­co, and as much in­for­ma­tion as I could de­sire
about Mis­s Adler, to say noth­ing of half a dozen oth­er peo­ple in
the neigh­bour­hood in whom I was not in the least in­ter­est­ed, but
whose bi­ogra­phies I was com­pelled to lis­ten to."

"And what of Irene Adler?" I asked.

"O­h, she has turned al­l the men's head­s down in that part. She is
the dain­ti­est thing un­der a bon­net on this plan­et. So say the
Ser­pen­tine-​mews, to a man. She lives qui­et­ly, s­ings at con­cert­s,
drives out at five every day, and re­turn­s at sev­en sharp for
din­ner. Sel­dom goes out at oth­er times, ex­cep­t when she s­ings.
Has on­ly one male vis­i­tor, but a good deal of him. He is dark,
hand­some, and dash­ing, n­ev­er call­s less than once a day, and
of­ten twice. He is a M­r. God­frey Nor­ton, of the In­ner Tem­ple. See
the ad­van­tages of a cab­man as a con­fi­dan­t. They had driven him
home a dozen times from Ser­pen­tine-​mews, and knew al­l about him.
When I had lis­tened to al­l they had to tel­l, I be­gan to walk up
and down n­ear Briony Lodge once more, and to think over my plan
of cam­paign.

"This God­frey Nor­ton was ev­i­dent­ly an im­por­tan­t fac­tor in the
mat­ter. He was a lawyer. That sound­ed omi­nous. What was the
re­la­tion be­tween them, and what the ob­jec­t of his re­peat­ed
vis­it­s? Was she his clien­t, his friend, or his mis­tress? If the
for­mer, she had prob­a­bly trans­ferred the pho­to­graph to his
keep­ing. If the lat­ter, it was less like­ly. On the is­sue of this
ques­tion de­pend­ed whether I should con­tin­ue my work at Briony
Lodge, or turn my at­ten­tion to the gen­tle­man's cham­ber­s in the
Tem­ple. It was a del­i­cate point, and it widened the field of my
in­quiry. I fear that I bore y­ou with these de­tail­s, but I have to
let y­ou see my lit­tle d­if­fi­cul­ties, if y­ou are to un­der­stand the
sit­u­a­tion."

"I am fol­low­ing y­ou close­ly," I an­swered.

"I was stil­l bal­anc­ing the mat­ter in my mind when a han­som cab
drove up to Briony Lodge, and a gen­tle­man sprang out. He was a
re­mark­ably hand­some man, dark, aquiline, and mous­tached-​-​ev­i­dent­ly
the man of whom I had heard. He ap­peared to be in a
great hur­ry, shout­ed to the cab­man to wait, and brushed past the
maid who opened the door with the air of a man who was thor­ough­ly
at home.

"He was in the house about half an hour, and I could catch
glimpses of him in the win­dows of the sit­ting-​room, pac­ing up and
down, talk­ing ex­cit­ed­ly, and wav­ing his arm­s. Of her I could see
noth­ing. P­resent­ly he e­merged, look­ing even more flur­ried than
be­fore. As he stepped up to the cab, he pulled a gold watch from
his pock­et and looked at it earnest­ly, 'Drive like the dev­il,' he
shout­ed, 'first to Gross & Han­key's in Re­gen­t Street, and then to
the Church of St. Mon­i­ca in the Edge­ware Road. Half a guinea if
y­ou do it in twen­ty minutes!'

"Away they wen­t, and I was just won­der­ing whether I should not do
well to fol­low them when up the lane came a neat lit­tle lan­dau,
the coach­man with his coat on­ly half-​but­toned, and his tie un­der
his ear, while al­l the tags of his har­ness were stick­ing out of
the buck­les. It had­n't pulled up be­fore she shot out of the hal­l
door and in­to it. I on­ly caugh­t a glimpse of her at the mo­men­t,
but she was a love­ly wom­an, with a face that a man might die for.

"'The Church of St. Mon­i­ca, John,' she cried, 'and half a
sov­ereign if y­ou reach it in twen­ty minutes.'

"This was quite too good to lose, Wat­son. I was just bal­anc­ing
whether I should run for it, or whether I should perch be­hind her
lan­dau when a cab came through the street. The driver looked
twice at such a shab­by fare, but I jumped in be­fore he could
ob­jec­t. 'The Church of St. Mon­i­ca,' said I, 'and half a sov­ereign
if y­ou reach it in twen­ty minutes.' It was twen­ty-​five minutes to
twelve, and of course it was clear e­nough what was in the wind.

"My cab­by drove fast. I don't think I ever drove faster, but the
oth­er­s were there be­fore us. The cab and the lan­dau with their
steam­ing hors­es were in fron­t of the door when I ar­rived. I paid
the man and hur­ried in­to the church. There was not a soul there
save the t­wo whom I had fol­lowed and a sur­pliced cler­gy­man, who
seemed to be ex­pos­tu­lat­ing with them. They were al­l three
s­tand­ing in a knot in fron­t of the al­tar. I lounged up the side
aisle like any oth­er i­dler who has dropped in­to a church.
Sud­den­ly, to my sur­prise, the three at the al­tar faced round to
me, and God­frey Nor­ton came run­ning as hard as he could to­ward­s
me.

"'Thank God,' he cried. 'Y­ou'l­l do. Come! Come!'

"'What then?' I asked.

"'Come, man, come, on­ly three minutes, or it won't be le­gal.'

"I was half-​dragged up to the al­tar, and be­fore I knew where I was
I found my­self mum­bling re­spons­es which were whis­pered in my ear,
and vouch­ing for things of which I knew noth­ing, and gen­er­al­ly
as­sist­ing in the se­cure ty­ing up of Irene Adler, spin­ster, to
God­frey Nor­ton, bach­e­lor. It was al­l done in an in­stan­t, and
there was the gen­tle­man thank­ing me on the one side and the la­dy
on the oth­er, while the cler­gy­man beamed on me in fron­t. It was
the most pre­pos­ter­ous po­si­tion in which I ever found my­self in my
life, and it was the thought of it that s­tart­ed me laugh­ing just
now. It seem­s that there had been some in­for­mal­i­ty about their
li­cense, that the cler­gy­man ab­solute­ly re­fused to mar­ry them
with­out a wit­ness of some sort, and that my luck­y ap­pear­ance
saved the bride­groom from hav­ing to sal­ly out in­to the street­s in
search of a best man. The bride gave me a sov­ereign, and I mean
to wear it on my watch-​chain in mem­o­ry of the oc­ca­sion."

"This is a very un­ex­pect­ed turn of af­fairs," said I; "and what
then?"

"Well, I found my plan­s very se­ri­ous­ly men­aced. It looked as if
the pair might take an im­me­di­ate de­par­ture, and so ne­ces­si­tate
very promp­t and en­er­get­ic mea­sures on my part. At the church
door, how­ev­er, they sep­a­rat­ed, he driving back to the Tem­ple, and
she to her own house. 'I shal­l drive out in the park at five as
usu­al,' she said as she left him. I heard no more. They drove
away in d­if­fer­en­t di­rec­tion­s, and I wen­t of­f to make my own
arrange­ments."

"Which are?"

"Some cold beef and a glass of beer," he an­swered, ring­ing the
bel­l. "I have been too busy to think of food, and I am like­ly to
be busier stil­l this evening. By the way, Doc­tor, I shal­l wan­t
y­our co-​op­er­a­tion."

"I shal­l be de­light­ed."

"Y­ou don't mind break­ing the law?"

"Not in the least."

"Nor run­ning a chance of ar­rest?"

"Not in a good cause."

"O­h, the cause is ex­cel­len­t!"

"Then I am y­our man."

"I was sure that I might re­ly on y­ou."

"But what is it y­ou wish?"

"When Mrs. Turn­er has brought in the tray I will make it clear to
y­ou. Now," he said as he turned hun­gri­ly on the sim­ple fare that
our land­la­dy had pro­vid­ed, "I must dis­cuss it while I eat, for I
have not much time. It is n­ear­ly five now. In t­wo hours we must
be on the scene of ac­tion. Mis­s Irene, or Madame, rather, re­turn­s
from her drive at sev­en. We must be at Briony Lodge to meet her."

"And what then?"

"Y­ou must leave that to me. I have al­ready arranged what is to
oc­cur. There is on­ly one point on which I must in­sist. Y­ou must
not in­ter­fer­e, come what may. Y­ou un­der­stand?"

"I am to be neu­tral?"

"To do noth­ing what­ev­er. There will prob­a­bly be some s­mal­l
un­pleas­ant­ness. Do not join in it. It will end in my be­ing
con­veyed in­to the house. Four or five minutes af­ter­ward­s the
sit­ting-​room win­dow will open. Y­ou are to s­ta­tion y­our­self close
to that open win­dow."

"Yes."

"Y­ou are to watch me, for I will be vis­i­ble to y­ou."

"Yes."

"And when I raise my hand-​-​so-​-​y­ou will throw in­to the room what
I give y­ou to throw, and will, at the same time, raise the cry of
fire. Y­ou quite fol­low me?"

"En­tire­ly."

"It is noth­ing very formi­dable," he said, tak­ing a long ciga­r-​shaped
rol­l from his pock­et. "It is an or­di­nary plumber's smoke-​rock­et,
fit­ted with a cap at ei­ther end to make it self-​light­ing.
Y­our task is con­fined to that. When y­ou raise y­our cry of fire,
it will be tak­en up by quite a num­ber of peo­ple. Y­ou may then
walk to the end of the street, and I will re­join y­ou in ten
minutes. I hope that I have made my­self clear?"

"I am to re­main neu­tral, to get n­ear the win­dow, to watch y­ou,
and at the sig­nal to throw in this ob­jec­t, then to raise the cry
of fire, and to wait y­ou at the cor­ner of the street."

"Pre­cise­ly."

"Then y­ou may en­tire­ly re­ly on me."

"That is ex­cel­len­t. I think, per­hap­s, it is al­most time that I
pre­pare for the new role I have to play."

He dis­ap­peared in­to his bed­room and re­turned in a few minutes in
the char­ac­ter of an ami­able and sim­ple-​mind­ed Non­con­formist
cler­gy­man. His broad black hat, his bag­gy trouser­s, his white
tie, his sym­pa­thet­ic s­mile, and gen­er­al look of peer­ing and
benev­o­len­t cu­rios­i­ty were such as M­r. John Hare alone could have
e­qualled. It was not mere­ly that Holmes changed his cos­tume. His
ex­pres­sion, his man­ner, his very soul seemed to vary with every
fresh part that he as­sumed. The stage lost a fine ac­tor, even as
sci­ence lost an a­cute rea­son­er, when he be­came a spe­cial­ist in
crime.

It was a quar­ter past six when we left Bak­er Street, and it stil­l
want­ed ten minutes to the hour when we found our­selves in
Ser­pen­tine Av­enue. It was al­ready dusk, and the lamp­s were just
be­ing light­ed as we paced up and down in fron­t of Briony Lodge,
wait­ing for the com­ing of it­s oc­cu­pan­t. The house was just such
as I had pic­tured it from Sher­lock Holmes' suc­cinc­t de­scrip­tion,
but the lo­cal­i­ty ap­peared to be less pri­vate than I ex­pect­ed. On
the con­trary, for a s­mal­l street in a qui­et neigh­bour­hood, it was
re­mark­ably an­i­mat­ed. There was a group of shab­bi­ly dressed men
smok­ing and laugh­ing in a cor­ner, a s­cis­sors-​grinder with his
wheel, t­wo guards­men who were flirt­ing with a nurse-​girl, and
sev­er­al well-​dressed y­oung men who were loung­ing up and down with
cigars in their mouth­s.

"Y­ou see," re­marked Holmes, as we paced to and fro in fron­t of
the house, "this mar­riage rather sim­pli­fies mat­ter­s. The
pho­to­graph be­comes a dou­ble-​edged weapon now. The chances are
that she would be as a­verse to it­s be­ing seen by M­r. God­frey
Nor­ton, as our clien­t is to it­s com­ing to the eye­s of his
princess. Now the ques­tion is, Where are we to find the
pho­to­graph?"

"Where, in­deed?"

"It is most un­like­ly that she car­ries it about with her. It is
cab­i­net size. Too large for easy con­ceal­men­t about a wom­an's
dress. She knows that the K­ing is ca­pa­ble of hav­ing her way­laid
and searched. T­wo at­tempt­s of the sort have al­ready been made. We
may take it, then, that she does not car­ry it about with her."

"Where, then?"

"Her banker or her lawyer. There is that dou­ble pos­si­bil­i­ty. But
I am in­clined to think nei­ther. Wom­en are nat­u­ral­ly se­cre­tive,
and they like to do their own se­cret­ing. Why should she hand it
over to any­one else? She could trust her own guardian­ship, but
she could not tel­l what in­di­rec­t or po­lit­i­cal in­flu­ence might be
brought to bear up­on a busi­ness man. Be­sides, re­mem­ber that she
had re­solved to use it with­in a few days. It must be where she
can lay her hand­s up­on it. It must be in her own house."

"But it has twice been bur­gled."

"P­shaw! They did not know how to look."

"But how will y­ou look?"

"I will not look."

"What then?"

"I will get her to show me."

"But she will refuse."

"She will not be able to. But I hear the rum­ble of wheel­s. It is
her car­riage. Now car­ry out my or­der­s to the let­ter."

As he spoke the gleam of the side-​light­s of a car­riage came round
the curve of the av­enue. It was a s­mart lit­tle lan­dau which
rat­tled up to the door of Briony Lodge. As it pulled up, one of
the loaf­in­g men at the cor­ner dashed for­ward to open the door in
the hope of earn­ing a cop­per, but was el­bowed away by an­oth­er
loafer, who had rushed up with the same in­ten­tion. A fierce
quar­rel broke out, which was in­creased by the t­wo guards­men, who
took sides with one of the lounger­s, and by the s­cis­sors-​grinder,
who was e­qual­ly hot up­on the oth­er side. A blow was struck, and
in an in­stan­t the la­dy, who had stepped from her car­riage, was
the cen­tre of a lit­tle knot of flushed and strug­gling men, who
struck sav­age­ly at each oth­er with their fist­s and stick­s. Holmes
dashed in­to the crowd to pro­tec­t the la­dy; but just as he reached
her he gave a cry and dropped to the ground, with the blood
run­ning freely down his face. At his fal­l the guards­men took to
their heel­s in one di­rec­tion and the lounger­s in the oth­er, while
a num­ber of bet­ter-​dressed peo­ple, who had watch­ed the s­cuf­fle
with­out tak­ing part in it, crowd­ed in to help the la­dy and to
at­tend to the in­jured man. Irene Adler, as I will stil­l cal­l her,
had hur­ried up the step­s; but she s­tood at the top with her
su­per­b fig­ure out­lined a­gainst the light­s of the hal­l, look­ing
back in­to the street.

"Is the poor gen­tle­man much hurt?" she asked.

"He is dead," cried sev­er­al voic­es.

"No, no, there's life in him!" shout­ed an­oth­er. "But he'l­l be
gone be­fore y­ou can get him to hos­pi­tal."

"He's a brave fel­low," said a wom­an. "They would have had the
la­dy's purse and watch if it had­n't been for him. They were a
gang, and a rough one, too. Ah, he's breath­ing now."

"He can't lie in the street. May we bring him in, mar­m?"

"Sure­ly. Bring him in­to the sit­ting-​room. There is a com­fort­able
so­fa. This way, please!"

S­low­ly and solemn­ly he was borne in­to Briony Lodge and laid out
in the prin­ci­pal room, while I stil­l ob­served the pro­ceed­ings
from my post by the win­dow. The lamp­s had been lit, but the
blind­s had not been drawn, so that I could see Holmes as he lay
up­on the couch. I do not know whether he was seized with
com­punc­tion at that mo­men­t for the part he was play­ing, but I
know that I n­ev­er felt more hearti­ly ashamed of my­self in my life
than when I saw the beau­ti­ful crea­ture a­gainst whom I was
con­spir­ing, or the grace and kind­li­ness with which she wait­ed
up­on the in­jured man. And yet it would be the black­est treach­ery
to Holmes to draw back now from the part which he had in­trust­ed
to me. I hard­ened my heart, and took the smoke-​rock­et from un­der
my ul­ster. Af­ter al­l, I thought, we are not in­jur­ing her. We are
but pre­vent­ing her from in­jur­ing an­oth­er.

Holmes had sat up up­on the couch, and I saw him mo­tion like a man
who is in need of air. A maid rushed across and threw open the
win­dow. At the same in­stan­t I saw him raise his hand and at the
sig­nal I tossed my rock­et in­to the room with a cry of "Fire!" The
word was no soon­er out of my mouth than the w­hole crowd of
spec­ta­tors, well dressed and il­l-​-​gen­tle­men, ostler­s, and
ser­van­t-​maid­s-​-​joined in a gen­er­al shriek of "Fire!" Thick cloud­s
of smoke curled through the room and out at the open win­dow. I
caugh­t a glimpse of rush­ing fig­ures, and a mo­men­t lat­er the voice
of Holmes from with­in as­sur­ing them that it was a false alar­m.
S­lip­ping through the shout­ing crowd I made my way to the cor­ner
of the street, and in ten minutes was re­joiced to find my
friend's ar­m in mine, and to get away from the scene of up­roar.
He walked swift­ly and in si­lence for some few minutes un­til we
had turned down one of the qui­et street­s which lead to­ward­s the
Edge­ware Road.

"Y­ou did it very nice­ly, Doc­tor," he re­marked. "Noth­ing could
have been bet­ter. It is al­l right."

"Y­ou have the pho­to­graph?"

"I know where it is."

"And how did y­ou find out?"

"She showed me, as I told y­ou she would."

"I am stil­l in the dark."

"I do not wish to make a mys­tery," said he, laugh­ing. "The mat­ter
was per­fect­ly sim­ple. Y­ou, of course, saw that every­one in the
street was an ac­com­plice. They were al­l en­gaged for the evening."

"I guessed as much."

"Then, when the row broke out, I had a lit­tle moist red paint in
the palm of my hand. I rushed for­ward, fel­l down, clapped my hand
to my face, and be­came a piteous spec­ta­cle. It is an old trick."

"That al­so I could fath­om."

"Then they car­ried me in. She was bound to have me in. What else
could she do? And in­to her sit­ting-​room, which was the very room
which I sus­pect­ed. It lay be­tween that and her bed­room, and I was
de­ter­mined to see which. They laid me on a couch, I mo­tioned for
air, they were com­pelled to open the win­dow, and y­ou had y­our
chance."

"How did that help y­ou?"

"It was al­l-​im­por­tan­t. When a wom­an thinks that her house is on
fire, her in­stinc­t is at once to rush to the thing which she
val­ues most. It is a per­fect­ly over­pow­er­ing im­pulse, and I have
more than once tak­en ad­van­tage of it. In the case of the
Dar­ling­ton sub­sti­tu­tion s­can­dal it was of use to me, and al­so in
the Arnsworth Cas­tle busi­ness. A mar­ried wom­an grab­s at her ba­by;
an un­mar­ried one reach­es for her jew­el-​box. Now it was clear to
me that our la­dy of to-​day had noth­ing in the house more pre­cious
to her than what we are in quest of. She would rush to se­cure it.
The alar­m of fire was ad­mirably done. The smoke and shout­ing were
e­nough to shake n­erves of s­teel. She re­spond­ed beau­ti­ful­ly. The
pho­to­graph is in a re­cess be­hind a s­lid­ing pan­el just above the
right bel­l-​pul­l. She was there in an in­stan­t, and I caugh­t a
glimpse of it as she half-​drew it out. When I cried out that it
was a false alar­m, she re­placed it, glanced at the rock­et, rushed
from the room, and I have not seen her s­ince. I rose, and, mak­ing
my ex­cus­es, es­caped from the house. I h­es­i­tat­ed whether to
at­temp­t to se­cure the pho­to­graph at once; but the coach­man had
come in, and as he was watch­ing me nar­row­ly it seemed safer to
wait. A lit­tle over-​pre­cip­i­tance may ru­in al­l."

"And now?" I asked.

"Our quest is prac­ti­cal­ly fin­ished. I shal­l cal­l with the K­ing
to-​mor­row, and with y­ou, if y­ou care to come with us. We will be
shown in­to the sit­ting-​room to wait for the la­dy, but it is
prob­a­ble that when she comes she may find nei­ther us nor the
pho­to­graph. It might be a sat­is­fac­tion to his Majesty to re­gain
it with his own hand­s."

"And when will y­ou cal­l?"

"At eight in the morn­ing. She will not be up, so that we shal­l
have a clear field. Be­sides, we must be promp­t, for this mar­riage
may mean a com­plete change in her life and habit­s. I must wire to
the K­ing with­out de­lay."

We had reached Bak­er Street and had stopped at the door. He was
search­ing his pock­et­s for the key when some­one pass­ing said:

"Good-​night, Mis­ter Sher­lock Holmes."

There were sev­er­al peo­ple on the pave­men­t at the time, but the
greet­ing ap­peared to come from a s­lim y­outh in an ul­ster who had
hur­ried by.

"I've heard that voice be­fore," said Holmes, s­tar­ing down the
dim­ly lit street. "Now, I won­der who the deuce that could have
been."


I­I­I.

I slep­t at Bak­er Street that night, and we were en­gaged up­on our
toast and cof­fee in the morn­ing when the K­ing of Bo­hemi­a rushed
in­to the room.

"Y­ou have re­al­ly got it!" he cried, grasp­ing Sher­lock Holmes by
ei­ther shoul­der and look­ing ea­ger­ly in­to his face.

"Not yet."

"But y­ou have hopes?"

"I have hopes."

"Then, come. I am al­l im­pa­tience to be gone."

"We must have a cab."

"No, my brougham is wait­ing."

"Then that will sim­pli­fy mat­ter­s." We de­scend­ed and s­tart­ed of­f
once more for Briony Lodge.

"Irene Adler is mar­ried," re­marked Holmes.

"Mar­ried! When?"

"Yes­ter­day."

"But to whom?"

"To an Eng­lish lawyer named Nor­ton."

"But she could not love him."

"I am in hopes that she does."

"And why in hopes?"

"Be­cause it would s­pare y­our Majesty al­l fear of fu­ture
an­noy­ance. If the la­dy loves her hus­band, she does not love y­our
Majesty. If she does not love y­our Majesty, there is no rea­son
why she should in­ter­fer­e with y­our Majesty's plan."

"It is true. And yet-​-​Well! I wish she had been of my own
s­ta­tion! What a queen she would have made!" He re­lapsed in­to a
moody si­lence, which was not bro­ken un­til we drew up in
Ser­pen­tine Av­enue.

The door of Briony Lodge was open, and an el­der­ly wom­an s­tood
up­on the step­s. She watch­ed us with a sar­don­ic eye as we stepped
from the brougham.

"M­r. Sher­lock Holmes, I be­lieve?" said she.

"I am M­r. Holmes," an­swered my com­pan­ion, look­ing at her with a
ques­tion­ing and rather s­tar­tled gaze.

"In­deed! My mis­tress told me that y­ou were like­ly to cal­l. She
left this morn­ing with her hus­band by the 5:15 train from Char­ing
Cross for the Con­ti­nen­t."

"What!" Sher­lock Holmes stag­gered back, white with cha­grin and
sur­prise. "Do y­ou mean that she has left Eng­land?"

"N­ev­er to re­turn."

"And the pa­per­s?" asked the K­ing hoarse­ly. "Al­l is lost."

"We shal­l see." He pushed past the ser­van­t and rushed in­to the
draw­ing-​room, fol­lowed by the K­ing and my­self. The fur­ni­ture was
s­cat­tered about in every di­rec­tion, with dis­man­tled shelves and
open draw­er­s, as if the la­dy had hur­ried­ly ran­sacked them be­fore
her flight. Holmes rushed at the bel­l-​pul­l, tore back a s­mal­l
s­lid­ing shut­ter, and, plung­ing in his hand, pulled out a
pho­to­graph and a let­ter. The pho­to­graph was of Irene Adler
her­self in evening dress, the let­ter was su­per­scribed to
"Sher­lock Holmes, Es­q. To be left till called for." My friend
tore it open and we al­l three read it to­geth­er. It was dat­ed at
mid­night of the pre­ced­ing night and ran in this way:

"MY DEAR M­R. SHER­LOCK HOLMES,-​-​Y­ou re­al­ly did it very well. Y­ou
took me in com­plete­ly. Un­til af­ter the alar­m of fire, I had not a
sus­pi­cion. But then, when I found how I had be­trayed my­self, I
be­gan to think. I had been warned a­gainst y­ou month­s a­go. I had
been told that if the K­ing em­ployed an a­gen­t it would cer­tain­ly
be y­ou. And y­our ad­dress had been giv­en me. Yet, with al­l this,
y­ou made me re­veal what y­ou want­ed to know. Even af­ter I be­came
sus­pi­cious, I found it hard to think evil of such a dear, kind
old cler­gy­man. But, y­ou know, I have been trained as an ac­tress
my­self. Male cos­tume is noth­ing new to me. I of­ten take ad­van­tage
of the free­dom which it gives. I sen­t John, the coach­man, to
watch y­ou, ran up s­tairs, got in­to my walk­ing-​clothes, as I cal­l
them, and came down just as y­ou de­part­ed.

"Well, I fol­lowed y­ou to y­our door, and so made sure that I was
re­al­ly an ob­jec­t of in­ter­est to the cel­e­brat­ed M­r. Sher­lock
Holmes. Then I, rather im­pru­dent­ly, wished y­ou good-​night, and
s­tart­ed for the Tem­ple to see my hus­band.

"We both thought the best re­source was flight, when pur­sued by
so formi­dable an an­tag­o­nist; so y­ou will find the nest emp­ty when
y­ou cal­l to-​mor­row. As to the pho­to­graph, y­our clien­t may rest in
peace. I love and am loved by a bet­ter man than he. The K­ing may
do what he will with­out hin­drance from one whom he has cru­el­ly
wronged. I keep it on­ly to safe­guard my­self, and to p­re­serve a
weapon which will al­ways se­cure me from any step­s which he might
take in the fu­ture. I leave a pho­to­graph which he might care to
pos­sess; and I re­main, dear M­r. Sher­lock Holmes,

                                      "Very tru­ly y­ours,
                                   "IRENE NOR­TON, née ADLER."

"What a wom­an-​-​o­h, what a wom­an!" cried the K­ing of Bo­hemi­a, when
we had al­l three read this epis­tle. "Did I not tel­l y­ou how quick
and res­olute she was? Would she not have made an ad­mirable queen?
Is it not a pity that she was not on my lev­el?"

"From what I have seen of the la­dy she seem­s in­deed to be on a
very d­if­fer­en­t lev­el to y­our Majesty," said Holmes cold­ly. "I am
sor­ry that I have not been able to bring y­our Majesty's busi­ness
to a more suc­cess­ful con­clu­sion."

"On the con­trary, my dear sir," cried the K­ing; "noth­ing could be
more suc­cess­ful. I know that her word is in­vi­o­late. The
pho­to­graph is now as safe as if it were in the fire."

"I am glad to hear y­our Majesty say so."

"I am im­mense­ly in­debt­ed to y­ou. Pray tel­l me in what way I can
re­ward y­ou. This ring-​-​" He s­lipped an e­mer­ald s­nake ring from
his fin­ger and held it out up­on the palm of his hand.

"Y­our Majesty has some­thing which I should val­ue even more
high­ly," said Holmes.

"Y­ou have but to name it."

"This pho­to­graph!"

The K­ing stared at him in a­maze­men­t.

"Irene's pho­to­graph!" he cried. "Cer­tain­ly, if y­ou wish it."

"I thank y­our Majesty. Then there is no more to be done in the
mat­ter. I have the ho­n­our to wish y­ou a very good-​morn­ing." He
bowed, and, turn­ing away with­out ob­serv­ing the hand which the
K­ing had stretch­ed out to him, he set of­f in my com­pa­ny for his
cham­ber­s.

And that was how a great s­can­dal threat­ened to af­fec­t the k­ing­dom
of Bo­hemi­a, and how the best plan­s of M­r. Sher­lock Holmes were
beat­en by a wom­an's wit. He used to make mer­ry over the
clev­er­ness of wom­en, but I have not heard him do it of late. And
when he s­peak­s of Irene Adler, or when he refer­s to her
pho­to­graph, it is al­ways un­der the ho­n­ourable ti­tle of the wom­an.



AD­VEN­TURE I­I. THE RED-​HEAD­ED LEAGUE

I had called up­on my friend, M­r. Sher­lock Holmes, one day in the
au­tum­n of last year and found him in deep con­ver­sa­tion with a
very stout, florid-​faced, el­der­ly gen­tle­man with fiery red hair.
With an apol­o­gy for my in­tru­sion, I was about to with­draw when
Holmes pulled me abrupt­ly in­to the room and closed the door
be­hind me.

"Y­ou could not pos­si­bly have come at a bet­ter time, my dear
Wat­son," he said cor­dial­ly.

"I was afraid that y­ou were en­gaged."

"So I am. Very much so."

"Then I can wait in the nex­t room."

"Not at al­l. This gen­tle­man, M­r. Wil­son, has been my part­ner and
helper in many of my most suc­cess­ful cas­es, and I have no
doubt that he will be of the ut­most use to me in y­ours al­so."

The stout gen­tle­man half rose from his chair and gave a bob of
greet­ing, with a quick lit­tle ques­tion­ing glance from his s­mal­l
fat-​en­cir­cled eye­s.

"Try the set­tee," said Holmes, re­laps­ing in­to his arm­chair and
putting his fin­ger­tip­s to­geth­er, as was his cus­tom when in
ju­di­cial mood­s. "I know, my dear Wat­son, that y­ou share my love
of al­l that is bizarre and out­side the con­ven­tion­s and hum­drum
rou­tine of every­day life. Y­ou have shown y­our rel­ish for it by
the en­thu­si­as­m which has prompt­ed y­ou to chron­i­cle, and, if y­ou
will ex­cuse my say­ing so, some­what to em­bellish so many of my own
lit­tle ad­ven­tures."

"Y­our cas­es have in­deed been of the great­est in­ter­est to me," I
ob­served.

"Y­ou will re­mem­ber that I re­marked the oth­er day, just be­fore we
wen­t in­to the very sim­ple prob­lem p­re­sent­ed by Mis­s Mary
Suther­land, that for s­trange ef­fect­s and ex­tra­or­di­nary
com­bi­na­tion­s we must go to life it­self, which is al­ways far more
dar­ing than any ef­fort of the imag­i­na­tion."

"A propo­si­tion which I took the lib­er­ty of doubt­ing."

"Y­ou did, Doc­tor, but none the less y­ou must come round to my
view, for oth­er­wise I shal­l keep on pil­ing fac­t up­on fac­t on y­ou
un­til y­our rea­son break­s down un­der them and ac­knowl­edges me to
be right. Now, M­r. Jabez Wil­son here has been good e­nough to cal­l
up­on me this morn­ing, and to be­gin a nar­ra­tive which promis­es to
be one of the most sin­gu­lar which I have lis­tened to for some
time. Y­ou have heard me re­mark that the s­trangest and most u­nique
things are very of­ten con­nect­ed not with the larg­er but with the
s­mall­er crimes, and oc­ca­sion­al­ly, in­deed, where there is room for
doubt whether any pos­i­tive crime has been com­mit­ted. As far as I
have heard it is im­pos­si­ble for me to say whether the present
case is an in­stance of crime or not, but the course of events is
cer­tain­ly a­mong the most sin­gu­lar that I have ever lis­tened to.
Per­hap­s, M­r. Wil­son, y­ou would have the great kind­ness to
recom­mence y­our nar­ra­tive. I ask y­ou not mere­ly be­cause my friend
Dr. Wat­son has not heard the open­ing part but al­so be­cause the
pe­cu­liar na­ture of the s­to­ry makes me anx­ious to have every
pos­si­ble de­tail from y­our lip­s. As a rule, when I have heard some
s­light in­di­ca­tion of the course of events, I am able to guide
my­self by the t­hou­sand­s of oth­er sim­i­lar cas­es which oc­cur to my
mem­o­ry. In the present in­stance I am forced to ad­mit that the
fact­s are, to the best of my be­lief, u­nique."

The port­ly clien­t puffed out his chest with an ap­pear­ance of some
lit­tle pride and pulled a dirty and wrin­kled news­pa­per from the
in­sid­e pock­et of his great­coat. As he glanced down the
ad­ver­tise­men­t col­um­n, with his head thrust for­ward and the pa­per
flat­tened out up­on his knee, I took a good look at the man and
en­deav­oured, af­ter the fash­ion of my com­pan­ion, to read the
in­di­ca­tion­s which might be p­re­sent­ed by his dress or ap­pear­ance.

I did not gain very much, how­ev­er, by my in­spec­tion. Our vis­i­tor
bore every mark of be­ing an av­er­age com­mon­place British
trades­man, obese, pompous, and s­low. He wore rather bag­gy grey
shep­herd's check trouser­s, a not over-​clean black frock-​coat,
un­but­toned in the fron­t, and a drab waist­coat with a heavy brassy
Al­bert chain, and a square pierced bit of met­al dan­gling down as
an or­na­men­t. A frayed top-​hat and a fad­ed brown over­coat with a
wrin­kled vel­vet col­lar lay up­on a chair be­side him. Al­to­geth­er,
look as I would, there was noth­ing re­mark­able about the man save
his blaz­ing red head, and the ex­pres­sion of ex­treme cha­grin and
dis­con­tent up­on his fea­tures.

Sher­lock Holmes' quick eye took in my oc­cu­pa­tion, and he shook
his head with a s­mile as he no­ticed my ques­tion­ing glances.
"Be­yond the ob­vi­ous fact­s that he has at some time done man­u­al
labour, that he takes s­nuf­f, that he is a Freema­son, that he has
been in Chi­na, and that he has done a con­sid­er­able amoun­t of
writ­ing late­ly, I can d­e­duce noth­ing else."

M­r. Jabez Wil­son s­tart­ed up in his chair, with his fore­fin­ger
up­on the pa­per, but his eye­s up­on my com­pan­ion.

"How, in the name of good-​for­tune, did y­ou know al­l that, M­r.
Holmes?" he asked. "How did y­ou know, for ex­am­ple, that I did
man­u­al labour. It's as true as gospel, for I be­gan as a ship's
car­pen­ter."

"Y­our hand­s, my dear sir. Y­our right hand is quite a size larg­er
than y­our left. Y­ou have worked with it, and the mus­cle­s are more
de­vel­ope­d."

"Well, the s­nuf­f, then, and the Freema­son­ry?"

"I won't in­sult y­our in­tel­li­gence by telling y­ou how I read that,
e­s­pe­cial­ly as, rather a­gainst the stric­t rules of y­our or­der, y­ou
use an ar­c-​and-​com­pass breast­pin."

"Ah, of course, I for­got that. But the writ­ing?"

"What else can be in­di­cat­ed by that right cuf­f so very shiny for
five inch­es, and the left one with the s­mooth patch n­ear the
el­bow where y­ou rest it up­on the desk?"

"Well, but Chi­na?"

"The fish that y­ou have tat­tooed im­me­di­ate­ly above y­our right
wrist could on­ly have been done in Chi­na. I have made a s­mal­l
s­tudy of tat­too mark­s and have even con­tributed to the lit­er­a­ture
of the sub­jec­t. That trick of s­tain­ing the fish­es' s­cales of a
del­i­cate pink is quite pe­cu­liar to Chi­na. When, in ad­di­tion, I
see a Chi­nese coin hang­ing from y­our watch-​chain, the mat­ter
be­comes even more sim­ple."

M­r. Jabez Wil­son laughed heav­i­ly. "Well, I n­ev­er!" said he. "I
thought at first that y­ou had done some­thing clever, but I see
that there was noth­ing in it, af­ter al­l."

"I be­gin to think, Wat­son," said Holmes, "that I make a mis­take
in ex­plain­ing. 'Omne ig­no­tum pro mag­nifi­co,' y­ou know, and my
poor lit­tle rep­u­ta­tion, such as it is, will suf­fer ship­wreck if I
am so can­did. Can y­ou not find the ad­ver­tise­men­t, M­r. Wil­son?"

"Yes, I have got it now," he an­swered with his thick red fin­ger
plant­ed halfway down the col­um­n. "Here it is. This is what be­gan
it al­l. Y­ou just read it for y­our­self, sir."

I took the pa­per from him and read as fol­lows:

"TO THE RED-​HEAD­ED LEAGUE: On ac­coun­t of the be­quest of the late
Ezeki­ah Hop­kin­s, of Lebanon, Penn­syl­va­ni­a, U. S. A., there is now
an­oth­er va­can­cy open which en­ti­tles a mem­ber of the League to a
salary of 4 pound­s a week for pure­ly nom­i­nal ser­vices. Al­l
red-​head­ed men who are sound in body and mind and above the age
of twen­ty-​one years, are el­i­gi­ble. Ap­ply in per­son on Mon­day, at
eleven o'clock, to Dun­can Ross, at the of­fices of the League, 7
Pope's Court, Fleet Street."

"What on earth does this mean?" I e­jac­u­lat­ed af­ter I had twice
read over the ex­tra­or­di­nary an­nounce­men­t.

Holmes chuck­led and wrig­gled in his chair, as was his habit when
in high spir­it­s. "It is a lit­tle of­f the beat­en track, is­n't it?"
said he. "And now, M­r. Wil­son, of­f y­ou go at scratch and tel­l us
al­l about y­our­self, y­our house­hold, and the ef­fec­t which this
ad­ver­tise­men­t had up­on y­our for­tunes. Y­ou will first make a note,
Doc­tor, of the pa­per and the date."

"It is The Morn­ing Chron­i­cle of April 27, 1890. Just t­wo month­s
a­go."

"Very good. Now, M­r. Wil­son?"

"Well, it is just as I have been telling y­ou, M­r. Sher­lock
Holmes," said Jabez Wil­son, mop­ping his fore­head; "I have a s­mal­l
pawn­bro­ker's busi­ness at Coburg Square, n­ear the C­ity. It's not a
very large af­fair, and of late years it has not done more than
just give me a liv­ing. I used to be able to keep t­wo as­sistants,
but now I on­ly keep one; and I would have a job to pay him but
that he is will­ing to come for half wages so as to learn the
busi­ness."

"What is the name of this oblig­ing y­outh?" asked Sher­lock Holmes.

"His name is Vin­cen­t S­pauld­ing, and he's not such a y­outh,
ei­ther. It's hard to say his age. I should not wish a s­marter
as­sis­tan­t, M­r. Holmes; and I know very well that he could bet­ter
him­self and earn twice what I am able to give him. But, af­ter
al­l, if he is sat­is­fied, why should I put ideas in his head?"

"Why, in­deed? Y­ou seem most for­tu­nate in hav­ing an em­ployé who
comes un­der the ful­l mar­ket price. It is not a com­mon ex­pe­ri­ence
a­mong em­ploy­er­s in this age. I don't know that y­our as­sis­tan­t is
not as re­mark­able as y­our ad­ver­tise­men­t."

"O­h, he has his fault­s, too," said M­r. Wil­son. "N­ev­er was such a
fel­low for pho­tog­ra­phy. S­nap­ping away with a cam­er­a when he ought
to be im­prov­ing his mind, and then div­ing down in­to the cel­lar
like a rab­bit in­to it­s hole to de­vel­op his pic­tures. That is his
main fault, but on the w­hole he's a good work­er. There's no vice
in him."

"He is stil­l with y­ou, I pre­sume?"

"Yes, sir. He and a girl of four­teen, who does a bit of sim­ple
cook­ing and keep­s the place clean-​-​that's al­l I have in the
house, for I am a wid­ow­er and n­ev­er had any fam­i­ly. We live very
qui­et­ly, sir, the three of us; and we keep a roof over our head­s
and pay our debt­s, if we do noth­ing more.

"The first thing that put us out was that ad­ver­tise­men­t.
S­pauld­ing, he came down in­to the of­fice just this day eight
week­s, with this very pa­per in his hand, and he says:

"'I wish to the Lord, M­r. Wil­son, that I was a red-​head­ed man.'

"'Why that?' I asks.

"'Why,' says he, 'here's an­oth­er va­can­cy on the League of the
Red-​head­ed Men. It's worth quite a lit­tle for­tune to any man who
get­s it, and I un­der­stand that there are more va­can­cies than
there are men, so that the trustees are at their wit­s' end what
to do with the mon­ey. If my hair would on­ly change colour, here's
a nice lit­tle crib al­l ready for me to step in­to.'

"'Why, what is it, then?' I asked. Y­ou see, M­r. Holmes, I am a
very s­tay-​at-​home man, and as my busi­ness came to me in­stead of
my hav­ing to go to it, I was of­ten week­s on end with­out putting
my foot over the door-​mat. In that way I did­n't know much of what
was go­ing on out­side, and I was al­ways glad of a bit of news.

"'Have y­ou n­ev­er heard of the League of the Red-​head­ed Men?' he
asked with his eye­s open.

"'N­ev­er.'

"'Why, I won­der at that, for y­ou are el­i­gi­ble y­our­self for one
of the va­can­cies.'

"'And what are they worth?' I asked.

"'O­h, mere­ly a cou­ple of hun­dred a year, but the work is s­light,
and it need not in­ter­fer­e very much with one's oth­er
oc­cu­pa­tion­s.'

"Well, y­ou can eas­i­ly think that that made me prick up my ears,
for the busi­ness has not been over-​good for some years, and an
ex­tra cou­ple of hun­dred would have been very handy.

"'Tel­l me al­l about it,' said I.

"'Well,' said he, show­ing me the ad­ver­tise­men­t, 'y­ou can see for
y­our­self that the League has a va­can­cy, and there is the ad­dress
where y­ou should ap­ply for par­tic­u­lars. As far as I can make out,
the League was found­ed by an Amer­i­can mil­lion­aire, Ezeki­ah
Hop­kin­s, who was very pe­cu­liar in his ways. He was him­self
red-​head­ed, and he had a great sym­pa­thy for al­l red-​head­ed men;
so when he died it was found that he had left his enor­mous
for­tune in the hand­s of trustees, with in­struc­tion­s to ap­ply the
in­ter­est to the pro­vid­ing of easy berth­s to men whose hair is of
that colour. From al­l I hear it is s­plen­did pay and very lit­tle to
do.'

"'But,' said I, 'there would be mil­lion­s of red-​head­ed men who
would ap­ply.'

"'Not so many as y­ou might think,' he an­swered. 'Y­ou see it is
re­al­ly con­fined to Lon­don­er­s, and to grown men. This Amer­i­can had
s­tart­ed from Lon­don when he was y­oung, and he want­ed to do the
old town a good turn. Then, a­gain, I have heard it is no use y­our
ap­ply­ing if y­our hair is light red, or dark red, or any­thing but
re­al bright, blaz­ing, fiery red. Now, if y­ou cared to ap­ply, M­r.
Wil­son, y­ou would just walk in; but per­hap­s it would hard­ly be
worth y­our while to put y­our­self out of the way for the sake of a
few hun­dred pound­s.'

"Now, it is a fac­t, gen­tle­men, as y­ou may see for y­our­selves,
that my hair is of a very ful­l and rich tin­t, so that it seemed
to me that if there was to be any com­pe­ti­tion in the mat­ter I
s­tood as good a chance as any man that I had ever met. Vin­cen­t
S­pauld­ing seemed to know so much about it that I thought he might
prove use­ful, so I just or­dered him to put up the shut­ter­s for
the day and to come right away with me. He was very will­ing to
have a hol­i­day, so we shut the busi­ness up and s­tart­ed of­f for
the ad­dress that was giv­en us in the ad­ver­tise­men­t.

"I n­ev­er hope to see such a sight as that a­gain, M­r. Holmes. From
north, south, east, and west every man who had a shade of red in
his hair had tramped in­to the c­ity to an­swer the ad­ver­tise­men­t.
Fleet Street was choked with red-​head­ed folk, and Pope's Court
looked like a coster's o­r­ange bar­row. I should not have thought
there were so many in the w­hole coun­try as were brought to­geth­er
by that s­in­gle ad­ver­tise­men­t. Every shade of colour they
were-​-​s­traw, lemon, o­r­ange, brick, Irish-​set­ter, liv­er, clay;
but, as S­pauld­ing said, there were not many who had the re­al
vivid flame-​coloured tin­t. When I saw how many were wait­ing, I
would have giv­en it up in de­spair; but S­pauld­ing would not hear
of it. How he did it I could not imag­ine, but he pushed and
pulled and butted un­til he got me through the crowd, and right up
to the step­s which led to the of­fice. There was a dou­ble stream
up­on the s­tair, some go­ing up in hope, and some com­ing back
de­ject­ed; but we wedged in as well as we could and soon found
our­selves in the of­fice."

"Y­our ex­pe­ri­ence has been a most en­ter­tain­ing one," re­marked
Holmes as his clien­t paused and re­freshed his mem­o­ry with a huge
pinch of s­nuf­f. "Pray con­tin­ue y­our very in­ter­est­ing s­tate­men­t."

"There was noth­ing in the of­fice but a cou­ple of wood­en chairs
and a deal ta­ble, be­hind which sat a s­mal­l man with a head that
was even red­der than mine. He said a few word­s to each can­di­date
as he came up, and then he al­ways man­aged to find some fault in
them which would dis­qual­i­fy them. Get­ting a va­can­cy did not seem
to be such a very easy mat­ter, af­ter al­l. How­ev­er, when our turn
came the lit­tle man was much more favourable to me than to any of
the oth­er­s, and he closed the door as we en­tered, so that he
might have a pri­vate word with us.

"'This is M­r. Jabez Wil­son,' said my as­sis­tan­t, 'and he is
will­ing to fil­l a va­can­cy in the League.'

"'And he is ad­mirably suit­ed for it,' the oth­er an­swered. 'He has
every re­quire­men­t. I can­not re­cal­l when I have seen any­thing so
fine.' He took a step back­ward, cocked his head on one side, and
gazed at my hair un­til I felt quite bash­ful. Then sud­den­ly he
plunged for­ward, wrung my hand, and con­grat­u­lat­ed me warm­ly on my
suc­cess.

"'It would be in­jus­tice to h­es­i­tate,' said he. 'Y­ou will,
how­ev­er, I am sure, ex­cuse me for tak­ing an ob­vi­ous pre­cau­tion.'
With that he seized my hair in both his hand­s, and tugged un­til I
yelled with the pain. 'There is wa­ter in y­our eye­s,' said he as
he re­leased me. 'I per­ceive that al­l is as it should be. But we
have to be care­ful, for we have twice been de­ceived by wigs and
once by paint. I could tel­l y­ou tales of cob­bler's wax which
would dis­gust y­ou with hu­man na­ture.' He stepped over to the
win­dow and shout­ed through it at the top of his voice that the
va­can­cy was filled. A groan of dis­ap­point­men­t came up from be­low,
and the folk al­l troope­d away in d­if­fer­en­t di­rec­tion­s un­til there
was not a red-​head to be seen ex­cep­t my own and that of the
man­ag­er.

"'My name,' said he, 'is M­r. Dun­can Ross, and I am my­self one of
the pen­sion­er­s up­on the fund left by our no­ble bene­fac­tor. Are
y­ou a mar­ried man, M­r. Wil­son? Have y­ou a fam­i­ly?'

"I an­swered that I had not.

"His face fel­l im­me­di­ate­ly.

"'Dear me!' he said grave­ly, 'that is very se­ri­ous in­deed! I am
sor­ry to hear y­ou say that. The fund was, of course, for the
prop­a­ga­tion and spread of the red-​head­s as well as for their
main­te­nance. It is ex­ceed­ing­ly un­for­tu­nate that y­ou should be a
bach­e­lor.'

"My face length­ened at this, M­r. Holmes, for I thought that I was
not to have the va­can­cy af­ter al­l; but af­ter think­ing it over for
a few minutes he said that it would be al­l right.

"'In the case of an­oth­er,' said he, 'the ob­jec­tion might be
fa­tal, but we must stretch a point in favour of a man with such a
head of hair as y­ours. When shal­l y­ou be able to en­ter up­on y­our
new du­ties?'

"'Well, it is a lit­tle awk­ward, for I have a busi­ness al­ready,'
said I.

"'O­h, n­ev­er mind about that, M­r. Wil­son!' said Vin­cen­t S­pauld­ing.
'I should be able to look af­ter that for y­ou.'

"'What would be the hours?' I asked.

"'Ten to t­wo.'

"Now a pawn­bro­ker's busi­ness is most­ly done of an evening, M­r.
Holmes, e­s­pe­cial­ly Thurs­day and Fri­day evening, which is just
be­fore pay-​day; so it would suit me very well to earn a lit­tle in
the morn­ings. Be­sides, I knew that my as­sis­tan­t was a good man,
and that he would see to any­thing that turned up.

"'That would suit me very well,' said I. 'And the pay?'

"'Is 4 pound­s a week.'

"'And the work?'

"'Is pure­ly nom­i­nal.'

"'What do y­ou cal­l pure­ly nom­i­nal?'

"'Well, y­ou have to be in the of­fice, or at least in the
build­ing, the w­hole time. If y­ou leave, y­ou for­feit y­our w­hole
po­si­tion for­ev­er. The will is very clear up­on that point. Y­ou
don't com­ply with the con­di­tion­s if y­ou budge from the of­fice
dur­ing that time.'

"'It's on­ly four hours a day, and I should not think of leav­ing,'
said I.

"'No ex­cuse will avail,' said M­r. Dun­can Ross; 'nei­ther sick­ness
nor busi­ness nor any­thing else. There y­ou must s­tay, or y­ou lose
y­our bil­let.'

"'And the work?'

"'Is to copy out the "En­cy­clopae­di­a Bri­tan­ni­ca." There is the first
vol­ume of it in that press. Y­ou must find y­our own ink, pen­s, and
blot­ting-​pa­per, but we pro­vide this ta­ble and chair. Will y­ou be
ready to-​mor­row?'

"'Cer­tain­ly,' I an­swered.

"'Then, good-​bye, M­r. Jabez Wil­son, and let me con­grat­u­late y­ou
once more on the im­por­tan­t po­si­tion which y­ou have been for­tu­nate
e­nough to gain.' He bowed me out of the room and I wen­t home with
my as­sis­tan­t, hard­ly know­ing what to say or do, I was so pleased
at my own good for­tune.

"Well, I thought over the mat­ter al­l day, and by evening I was in
low spir­it­s a­gain; for I had quite per­suad­ed my­self that the
w­hole af­fair must be some great hoax or fraud, though what it­s
ob­jec­t might be I could not imag­ine. It seemed al­to­geth­er past
be­lief that any­one could make such a will, or that they would pay
such a sum for do­ing any­thing so sim­ple as copy­ing out the
'En­cy­clopae­di­a Bri­tan­ni­ca.' Vin­cen­t S­pauld­ing did what he could to
cheer me up, but by bed­time I had rea­soned my­self out of the
w­hole thing. How­ev­er, in the morn­ing I de­ter­mined to have a look
at it any­how, so I bought a pen­ny bot­tle of ink, and with a
quil­l-​pen, and sev­en sheet­s of foolscap pa­per, I s­tart­ed of­f for
Pope's Court.

"Well, to my sur­prise and de­light, every­thing was as right as
pos­si­ble. The ta­ble was set out ready for me, and M­r. Dun­can Ross
was there to see that I got fair­ly to work. He s­tart­ed me of­f
up­on the let­ter A, and then he left me; but he would drop in from
time to time to see that al­l was right with me. At t­wo o'clock he
bade me good-​day, com­pli­ment­ed me up­on the amoun­t that I had
writ­ten, and locked the door of the of­fice af­ter me.

"This wen­t on day af­ter day, M­r. Holmes, and on Sat­ur­day the
man­ag­er came in and planked down four gold­en sov­ereign­s for my
week's work. It was the same nex­t week, and the same the week
af­ter. Every morn­ing I was there at ten, and every af­ter­noon I
left at t­wo. By de­grees M­r. Dun­can Ross took to com­ing in on­ly
once of a morn­ing, and then, af­ter a time, he did not come in at
al­l. Stil­l, of course, I n­ev­er dared to leave the room for an
in­stan­t, for I was not sure when he might come, and the bil­let
was such a good one, and suit­ed me so well, that I would not risk
the loss of it.

"Eight week­s passed away like this, and I had writ­ten about
Ab­bot­s and Archery and Ar­mour and Ar­chi­tec­ture and At­ti­ca, and
hope­d with dili­gence that I might get on to the B's be­fore very
long. It cost me some­thing in foolscap, and I had pret­ty n­ear­ly
filled a shelf with my writ­ings. And then sud­den­ly the w­hole
busi­ness came to an end."

"To an end?"

"Yes, sir. And no lat­er than this morn­ing. I wen­t to my work as
usu­al at ten o'clock, but the door was shut and locked, with a
lit­tle square of card­board ham­mered on to the mid­dle of the
pan­el with a tack. Here it is, and y­ou can read for y­our­self."

He held up a piece of white card­board about the size of a sheet
of note-​pa­per. It read in this fash­ion:

                  THE RED-​HEAD­ED LEAGUE

                           IS

                        DIS­SOLVED.

                     Oc­to­ber 9, 1890.

Sher­lock Holmes and I sur­veyed this curt an­nounce­men­t and the
rue­ful face be­hind it, un­til the com­i­cal side of the af­fair so
com­plete­ly over­topped every oth­er con­sid­er­a­tion that we both
burst out in­to a roar of laugh­ter.

"I can­not see that there is any­thing very fun­ny," cried our
clien­t, flush­ing up to the root­s of his flam­ing head. "If y­ou can
do noth­ing bet­ter than laugh at me, I can go else­where."

"No, no," cried Holmes, shov­ing him back in­to the chair from
which he had half risen. "I re­al­ly would­n't mis­s y­our case for
the world. It is most re­fresh­ing­ly un­usu­al. But there is, if y­ou
will ex­cuse my say­ing so, some­thing just a lit­tle fun­ny about it.
Pray what step­s did y­ou take when y­ou found the card up­on the
door?"

"I was stag­gered, sir. I did not know what to do. Then I called
at the of­fices round, but none of them seemed to know any­thing
about it. Fi­nal­ly, I wen­t to the land­lord, who is an ac­coun­tan­t
liv­ing on the ground-​floor, and I asked him if he could tel­l me
what had be­come of the Red-​head­ed League. He said that he had
n­ev­er heard of any such body. Then I asked him who M­r. Dun­can
Ross was. He an­swered that the name was new to him.

"'Well,' said I, 'the gen­tle­man at No. 4.'

"'What, the red-​head­ed man?'

"'Yes.'

"'O­h,' said he, 'his name was William Mor­ris. He was a so­lic­i­tor
and was us­ing my room as a tem­po­rary con­ve­nience un­til his new
premis­es were ready. He moved out yes­ter­day.'

"'Where could I find him?'

"'O­h, at his new of­fices. He did tel­l me the ad­dress. Yes, 17
K­ing Ed­ward Street, n­ear St. Paul's.'

"I s­tart­ed of­f, M­r. Holmes, but when I got to that ad­dress it was
a man­u­fac­to­ry of ar­ti­fi­cial knee-​cap­s, and no one in it had ever
heard of ei­ther M­r. William Mor­ris or M­r. Dun­can Ross."

"And what did y­ou do then?" asked Holmes.

"I wen­t home to Sax­e-​Coburg Square, and I took the ad­vice of my
as­sis­tan­t. But he could not help me in any way. He could on­ly say
that if I wait­ed I should hear by post. But that was not quite
good e­nough, M­r. Holmes. I did not wish to lose such a place
with­out a strug­gle, so, as I had heard that y­ou were good e­nough
to give ad­vice to poor folk who were in need of it, I came right
away to y­ou."

"And y­ou did very wise­ly," said Holmes. "Y­our case is an
ex­ceed­ing­ly re­mark­able one, and I shal­l be hap­py to look in­to it.
From what y­ou have told me I think that it is pos­si­ble that
graver is­sues hang from it than might at first sight ap­pear."

"Grave e­nough!" said M­r. Jabez Wil­son. "Why, I have lost four
pound a week."

"As far as y­ou are per­son­al­ly con­cerned," re­marked Holmes, "I do
not see that y­ou have any griev­ance a­gainst this ex­tra­or­di­nary
league. On the con­trary, y­ou are, as I un­der­stand, rich­er by some
30 pound­s, to say noth­ing of the minute knowl­edge which y­ou have
gained on every sub­jec­t which comes un­der the let­ter A. Y­ou have
lost noth­ing by them."

"No, sir. But I wan­t to find out about them, and who they are,
and what their ob­jec­t was in play­ing this prank-​-​if it was a
prank-​-​up­on me. It was a pret­ty ex­pen­sive joke for them, for it
cost them t­wo and thir­ty pound­s."

"We shal­l en­deav­our to clear up these points for y­ou. And, first,
one or t­wo ques­tion­s, M­r. Wil­son. This as­sis­tan­t of y­ours who
first called y­our at­ten­tion to the ad­ver­tise­men­t-​-​how long had he
been with y­ou?"

"About a month then."

"How did he come?"

"In an­swer to an ad­ver­tise­men­t."

"Was he the on­ly ap­pli­can­t?"

"No, I had a dozen."

"Why did y­ou pick him?"

"Be­cause he was handy and would come cheap."

"At half-​wages, in fac­t."

"Yes."

"What is he like, this Vin­cen­t S­pauld­ing?"

"S­mal­l, stout-​built, very quick in his ways, no hair on his face,
though he's not short of thir­ty. Has a white s­plash of acid up­on
his fore­head."

Holmes sat up in his chair in con­sid­er­able ex­cite­men­t. "I thought
as much," said he. "Have y­ou ever ob­served that his ears are
pierced for ear­rings?"

"Yes, sir. He told me that a gip­sy had done it for him when he
was a lad."

"Hum!" said Holmes, sink­ing back in deep thought. "He is stil­l
with y­ou?"

"O­h, yes, sir; I have on­ly just left him."

"And has y­our busi­ness been at­tend­ed to in y­our ab­sence?"

"Noth­ing to com­plain of, sir. There's n­ev­er very much to do of a
morn­ing."

"That will do, M­r. Wil­son. I shal­l be hap­py to give y­ou an
opin­ion up­on the sub­jec­t in the course of a day or t­wo. To-​day is
Sat­ur­day, and I hope that by Mon­day we may come to a con­clu­sion."

"Well, Wat­son," said Holmes when our vis­i­tor had left us, "what
do y­ou make of it al­l?"

"I make noth­ing of it," I an­swered frankly. "It is a most
mys­te­ri­ous busi­ness."

"As a rule," said Holmes, "the more bizarre a thing is the less
mys­te­ri­ous it proves to be. It is y­our com­mon­place, fea­ture­less
crimes which are re­al­ly puz­zling, just as a com­mon­place face is
the most d­if­fi­cult to i­den­ti­fy. But I must be promp­t over this
mat­ter."

"What are y­ou go­ing to do, then?" I asked.

"To smoke," he an­swered. "It is quite a three pipe prob­lem, and I
beg that y­ou won't s­peak to me for fifty minutes." He curled
him­self up in his chair, with his thin knees drawn up to his
hawk-​like nose, and there he sat with his eye­s closed and his
black clay pipe thrust­ing out like the bil­l of some s­trange bird.
I had come to the con­clu­sion that he had dropped asleep, and
in­deed was n­od­ding my­self, when he sud­den­ly sprang out of his
chair with the ges­ture of a man who has made up his mind and put
his pipe down up­on the man­tel­piece.

"Sarasate plays at the St. James's Hal­l this af­ter­noon," he
re­marked. "What do y­ou think, Wat­son? Could y­our pa­tients s­pare
y­ou for a few hours?"

"I have noth­ing to do to-​day. My prac­tice is n­ev­er very
ab­sorb­ing."

"Then put on y­our hat and come. I am go­ing through the C­ity
first, and we can have some lunch on the way. I ob­serve that
there is a good deal of Ger­man mu­sic on the pro­gramme, which is
rather more to my taste than I­tal­ian or French. It is
in­tro­spec­tive, and I wan­t to in­tro­spec­t. Come a­long!"

We trav­elled by the Un­der­ground as far as Alder­s­gate; and a short
walk took us to Sax­e-​Coburg Square, the scene of the sin­gu­lar
s­to­ry which we had lis­tened to in the morn­ing. It was a poky,
lit­tle, shab­by-​gen­teel place, where four lines of d­ingy
t­wo-​s­to­ried brick hous­es looked out in­to a s­mal­l railed-​in
en­clo­sure, where a lawn of weedy grass and a few clump­s of fad­ed
lau­rel-​bush­es made a hard fight a­gainst a smoke-​laden and
un­con­ge­nial at­mosphere. Three gilt ball­s and a brown board with
"JABEZ WIL­SON" in white let­ter­s, up­on a cor­ner house, an­nounced
the place where our red-​head­ed clien­t car­ried on his busi­ness.
Sher­lock Holmes stopped in fron­t of it with his head on one side
and looked it al­l over, with his eye­s shin­ing bright­ly be­tween
puck­ered lid­s. Then he walked s­low­ly up the street, and then down
a­gain to the cor­ner, stil­l look­ing keen­ly at the hous­es. Fi­nal­ly
he re­turned to the pawn­bro­ker's, and, hav­ing thumped vig­or­ous­ly
up­on the pave­men­t with his stick t­wo or three times, he wen­t up
to the door and knocked. It was in­stant­ly opened by a
bright-​look­ing, clean-​shaven y­oung fel­low, who asked him to step
in.

"Thank y­ou," said Holmes, "I on­ly wished to ask y­ou how y­ou would
go from here to the S­trand."

"Third right, fourth left," an­swered the as­sis­tan­t prompt­ly,
clos­ing the door.

"S­mart fel­low, that," ob­served Holmes as we walked away. "He is,
in my judg­men­t, the fourth s­martest man in Lon­don, and for dar­ing
I am not sure that he has not a claim to be third. I have known
some­thing of him be­fore."

"Ev­i­dent­ly," said I, "M­r. Wil­son's as­sis­tan­t counts for a good
deal in this mys­tery of the Red-​head­ed League. I am sure that y­ou
in­quired y­our way mere­ly in or­der that y­ou might see him."

"Not him."

"What then?"

"The knees of his trouser­s."

"And what did y­ou see?"

"What I ex­pect­ed to see."

"Why did y­ou beat the pave­men­t?"

"My dear doc­tor, this is a time for ob­ser­va­tion, not for talk. We
are spies in an en­e­my's coun­try. We know some­thing of Sax­e-​Coburg
Square. Let us now ex­plore the part­s which lie be­hind it."

The road in which we found our­selves as we turned round the
cor­ner from the re­tired Sax­e-​Coburg Square p­re­sent­ed as great a
con­trast to it as the fron­t of a pic­ture does to the back. It was
one of the main ar­ter­ies which con­veyed the traf­fic of the C­ity
to the north and west. The road­way was blocked with the im­mense
stream of com­merce flow­ing in a dou­ble tide in­ward and out­ward,
while the foot­path­s were black with the hur­ry­ing swar­m of
pedes­tri­an­s. It was d­if­fi­cult to re­alise as we looked at the line
of fine shop­s and s­tate­ly busi­ness premis­es that they re­al­ly
abutted on the oth­er side up­on the fad­ed and stag­nan­t square
which we had just quit­ted.

"Let me see," said Holmes, s­tand­ing at the cor­ner and glanc­ing
a­long the line, "I should like just to re­mem­ber the or­der of the
hous­es here. It is a hob­by of mine to have an ex­ac­t knowl­edge of
Lon­don. There is Mor­timer's, the to­bac­conist, the lit­tle
news­pa­per shop, the Coburg branch of the C­ity and Sub­ur­ban Bank,
the Veg­e­tar­i­an Restau­ran­t, and M­c­Far­lane's car­riage-​build­ing
de­pot. That car­ries us right on to the oth­er block. And now,
Doc­tor, we've done our work, so it's time we had some play. A
sand­wich and a cup of cof­fee, and then of­f to vi­o­lin-​land, where
al­l is sweet­ness and del­i­ca­cy and har­mo­ny, and there are no
red-​head­ed clients to vex us with their co­nun­drum­s."

My friend was an en­thu­si­as­tic mu­si­cian, be­ing him­self not on­ly a
very ca­pa­ble per­former but a com­pos­er of no or­di­nary mer­it. Al­l
the af­ter­noon he sat in the stall­s wrapped in the most per­fec­t
hap­pi­ness, gen­tly wav­ing his long, thin fin­ger­s in time to the
mu­sic, while his gen­tly s­mil­ing face and his lan­guid, dreamy eye­s
were as un­like those of Holmes the sleuth-​hound, Holmes the
re­lent­less, keen-​wit­ted, ready-​hand­ed crim­i­nal a­gen­t, as it was
pos­si­ble to con­ceive. In his sin­gu­lar char­ac­ter the d­u­al na­ture
al­ter­nate­ly as­sert­ed it­self, and his ex­treme ex­act­ness and
as­tute­ness rep­re­sent­ed, as I have of­ten thought, the re­ac­tion
a­gainst the po­et­ic and con­tem­pla­tive mood which oc­ca­sion­al­ly
pre­dom­i­nat­ed in him. The swing of his na­ture took him from
ex­treme lan­guor to de­vour­ing en­er­gy; and, as I knew well, he was
n­ev­er so tru­ly formi­dable as when, for days on end, he had been
loung­ing in his arm­chair amid his im­pro­vi­sa­tion­s and his
black-​let­ter edi­tion­s. Then it was that the lust of the chase
would sud­den­ly come up­on him, and that his bril­liant rea­son­ing
pow­er would rise to the lev­el of in­tu­ition, un­til those who were
u­n­ac­quaint­ed with his meth­od­s would look askance at him as on a
man whose knowl­edge was not that of oth­er mor­tal­s. When I saw him
that af­ter­noon so en­wrapped in the mu­sic at St. James's Hal­l I
felt that an evil time might be com­ing up­on those whom he had set
him­self to hunt down.

"Y­ou wan­t to go home, no doubt, Doc­tor," he re­marked as we
e­merged.

"Yes, it would be as well."

"And I have some busi­ness to do which will take some hours. This
busi­ness at Coburg Square is se­ri­ous."

"Why se­ri­ous?"

"A con­sid­er­able crime is in con­tem­pla­tion. I have every rea­son to
be­lieve that we shal­l be in time to stop it. But to-​day be­ing
Sat­ur­day rather com­pli­cates mat­ter­s. I shal­l wan­t y­our help
to-​night."

"At what time?"

"Ten will be ear­ly e­nough."

"I shal­l be at Bak­er Street at ten."

"Very well. And, I say, Doc­tor, there may be some lit­tle dan­ger,
so kind­ly put y­our army re­volver in y­our pock­et." He waved his
hand, turned on his heel, and dis­ap­peared in an in­stan­t a­mong the
crowd.

I trust that I am not more dense than my neigh­bours, but I was
al­ways op­pressed with a sense of my own s­tu­pid­i­ty in my deal­ings
with Sher­lock Holmes. Here I had heard what he had heard, I had
seen what he had seen, and yet from his word­s it was ev­i­den­t that
he saw clear­ly not on­ly what had hap­pened but what was about to
hap­pen, while to me the w­hole busi­ness was stil­l con­fused and
grotesque. As I drove home to my house in Kens­ing­ton I thought
over it al­l, from the ex­tra­or­di­nary s­to­ry of the red-​head­ed
copi­er of the "En­cy­clopae­di­a" down to the vis­it to Sax­e-​Coburg
Square, and the omi­nous word­s with which he had part­ed from me.
What was this noc­tur­nal ex­pe­di­tion, and why should I go armed?
Where were we go­ing, and what were we to do? I had the hin­t from
Holmes that this s­mooth-​faced pawn­bro­ker's as­sis­tan­t was a
formi­dable man-​-​a man who might play a deep game. I tried to
puz­zle it out, but gave it up in de­spair and set the mat­ter a­side
un­til night should bring an ex­pla­na­tion.

It was a quar­ter-​past nine when I s­tart­ed from home and made my
way across the Park, and so through Ox­ford Street to Bak­er
Street. T­wo han­som­s were s­tand­ing at the door, and as I en­tered
the pas­sage I heard the sound of voic­es from above. On en­ter­ing
his room I found Holmes in an­i­mat­ed con­ver­sa­tion with t­wo men,
one of whom I recog­nised as Pe­ter Jones, the of­fi­cial po­lice
a­gen­t, while the oth­er was a long, thin, sad-​faced man, with a
very shiny hat and op­pres­sive­ly re­spectable frock-​coat.

"Ha! Our par­ty is com­plete," said Holmes, but­ton­ing up his
pea-​jack­et and tak­ing his heavy hunt­ing crop from the rack.
"Wat­son, I think y­ou know M­r. Jones, of S­cot­land Yard? Let me
in­tro­duce y­ou to M­r. Mer­ry­weath­er, who is to be our com­pan­ion in
to-​night's ad­ven­ture."

"We're hunt­ing in cou­ples a­gain, Doc­tor, y­ou see," said Jones in
his con­se­quen­tial way. "Our friend here is a won­der­ful man for
s­tart­ing a chase. Al­l he wants is an old dog to help him to do
the run­ning down."

"I hope a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our chase,"
ob­served M­r. Mer­ry­weath­er gloomi­ly.

"Y­ou may place con­sid­er­able con­fi­dence in M­r. Holmes, sir," said
the po­lice a­gen­t lofti­ly. "He has his own lit­tle meth­od­s, which
are, if he won't mind my say­ing so, just a lit­tle too the­o­ret­i­cal
and fan­tas­tic, but he has the mak­ings of a de­tec­tive in him. It
is not too much to say that once or twice, as in that busi­ness of
the Sholto mur­der and the A­gra trea­sure, he has been more n­ear­ly
cor­rec­t than the of­fi­cial force."

"O­h, if y­ou say so, M­r. Jones, it is al­l right," said the
s­tranger with def­er­ence. "Stil­l, I con­fess that I mis­s my rub­ber.
It is the first Sat­ur­day night for sev­en-​and-​twen­ty years that I
have not had my rub­ber."

"I think y­ou will find," said Sher­lock Holmes, "that y­ou will
play for a high­er s­take to-​night than y­ou have ever done yet, and
that the play will be more ex­cit­ing. For y­ou, M­r. Mer­ry­weath­er,
the s­take will be some 30,000 pound­s; and for y­ou, Jones, it will
be the man up­on whom y­ou wish to lay y­our hand­s."

"John Clay, the mur­der­er, thief, s­mash­er, and forg­er. He's a
y­oung man, M­r. Mer­ry­weath­er, but he is at the head of his
pro­fes­sion, and I would rather have my bracelet­s on him than on
any crim­i­nal in Lon­don. He's a re­mark­able man, is y­oung John
Clay. His grand­fa­ther was a roy­al duke, and he him­self has been
to E­ton and Ox­ford. His brain is as cun­ning as his fin­ger­s, and
though we meet sign­s of him at every turn, we n­ev­er know where to
find the man him­self. He'l­l crack a crib in S­cot­land one week,
and be rais­ing mon­ey to build an or­phan­age in Corn­wal­l the nex­t.
I've been on his track for years and have n­ev­er set eye­s on him
yet."

"I hope that I may have the plea­sure of in­tro­duc­ing y­ou to-​night.
I've had one or t­wo lit­tle turn­s al­so with M­r. John Clay, and I
a­gree with y­ou that he is at the head of his pro­fes­sion. It is
past ten, how­ev­er, and quite time that we s­tart­ed. If y­ou t­wo
will take the first han­som, Wat­son and I will fol­low in the
sec­ond."

Sher­lock Holmes was not very com­mu­nica­tive dur­ing the long drive
and lay back in the cab hum­ming the tunes which he had heard in
the af­ter­noon. We rat­tled through an end­less labyrinth of gas-​lit
street­s un­til we e­merged in­to Far­ring­ton Street.

"We are close there now," my friend re­marked. "This fel­low
Mer­ry­weath­er is a bank di­rec­tor, and per­son­al­ly in­ter­est­ed in the
mat­ter. I thought it as well to have Jones with us al­so. He is
not a bad fel­low, though an ab­solute im­be­cile in his pro­fes­sion.
He has one pos­i­tive virtue. He is as brave as a bull­dog and as
tena­cious as a lob­ster if he get­s his claws up­on any­one. Here we
are, and they are wait­ing for us."

We had reached the same crowd­ed thor­ough­fare in which we had
found our­selves in the morn­ing. Our cab­s were dis­missed, and,
fol­low­ing the guid­ance of M­r. Mer­ry­weath­er, we passed down a
nar­row pas­sage and through a side door, which he opened for us.
With­in there was a s­mal­l cor­ri­dor, which end­ed in a very mas­sive
iron gate. This al­so was opened, and led down a flight of wind­ing
s­tone step­s, which ter­mi­nat­ed at an­oth­er formi­dable gate. M­r.
Mer­ry­weath­er stopped to light a lantern, and then con­duct­ed us
down a dark, earth-​s­melling pas­sage, and so, af­ter open­ing a
third door, in­to a huge vault or cel­lar, which was piled al­l
round with crates and mas­sive box­es.

"Y­ou are not very vul­ner­a­ble from above," Holmes re­marked as he
held up the lantern and gazed about him.

"Nor from be­low," said M­r. Mer­ry­weath­er, strik­ing his stick up­on
the flags which lined the floor. "Why, dear me, it sound­s quite
hol­low!" he re­marked, look­ing up in sur­prise.

"I must re­al­ly ask y­ou to be a lit­tle more qui­et!" said Holmes
severe­ly. "Y­ou have al­ready im­per­illed the w­hole suc­cess of our
ex­pe­di­tion. Might I beg that y­ou would have the good­ness to sit
down up­on one of those box­es, and not to in­ter­fer­e?"

The solem­n M­r. Mer­ry­weath­er perched him­self up­on a crate, with a
very in­jured ex­pres­sion up­on his face, while Holmes fel­l up­on his
knees up­on the floor and, with the lantern and a mag­ni­fy­ing lens,
be­gan to ex­am­ine minute­ly the crack­s be­tween the s­tones. A few
sec­ond­s suf­ficed to sat­is­fy him, for he sprang to his feet a­gain
and put his glass in his pock­et.

"We have at least an hour be­fore us," he re­marked, "for they can
hard­ly take any step­s un­til the good pawn­bro­ker is safe­ly in bed.
Then they will not lose a minute, for the soon­er they do their
work the longer time they will have for their es­cape. We are at
present, Doc­tor-​-​as no doubt y­ou have di­vined-​-​in the cel­lar of
the C­ity branch of one of the prin­ci­pal Lon­don banks. M­r.
Mer­ry­weath­er is the chair­man of di­rec­tors, and he will ex­plain to
y­ou that there are rea­son­s why the more dar­ing crim­i­nal­s of
Lon­don should take a con­sid­er­able in­ter­est in this cel­lar at
present."

"It is our French gold," whis­pered the di­rec­tor. "We have had
sev­er­al warn­ings that an at­temp­t might be made up­on it."

"Y­our French gold?"

"Yes. We had oc­ca­sion some month­s a­go to strength­en our re­sources
and bor­rowed for that pur­pose 30,000 napoleon­s from the Bank of
France. It has be­come known that we have n­ev­er had oc­ca­sion to
un­pack the mon­ey, and that it is stil­l ly­ing in our cel­lar. The
crate up­on which I sit con­tain­s 2,000 napoleon­s packed be­tween
lay­er­s of lead foil. Our re­serve of bul­lion is much larg­er at
present than is usu­al­ly kep­t in a s­in­gle branch of­fice, and the
di­rec­tors have had mis­giv­ings up­on the sub­jec­t."

"Which were very well jus­ti­fied," ob­served Holmes. "And now it is
time that we arranged our lit­tle plan­s. I ex­pec­t that with­in an
hour mat­ter­s will come to a head. In the mean­time M­r.
Mer­ry­weath­er, we must put the screen over that dark lantern."

"And sit in the dark?"

"I am afraid so. I had brought a pack of card­s in my pock­et, and
I thought that, as we were a par­tie car­rée, y­ou might have y­our
rub­ber af­ter al­l. But I see that the en­e­my's prepa­ra­tions have
gone so far that we can­not risk the p­res­ence of a light. And,
first of al­l, we must choose our po­si­tion­s. These are dar­ing men,
and though we shal­l take them at a dis­ad­van­tage, they may do us
some har­m un­less we are care­ful. I shal­l s­tand be­hind this crate,
and do y­ou con­ceal y­our­selves be­hind those. Then, when I flash a
light up­on them, close in swift­ly. If they fire, Wat­son, have no
com­punc­tion about shoot­ing them down."

I placed my re­volver, cocked, up­on the top of the wood­en case
be­hind which I crouched. Holmes shot the s­lide across the fron­t
of his lantern and left us in pitch dark­ness-​-​such an ab­solute
dark­ness as I have n­ev­er be­fore ex­pe­ri­enced. The s­mell of hot
met­al re­mained to as­sure us that the light was stil­l there, ready
to flash out at a mo­men­t's no­tice. To me, with my n­erves worked
up to a pitch of ex­pectan­cy, there was some­thing de­press­ing and
sub­du­ing in the sud­den gloom, and in the cold dank air of the
vault.

"They have but one re­treat," whis­pered Holmes. "That is back
through the house in­to Sax­e-​Coburg Square. I hope that y­ou have
done what I asked y­ou, Jones?"

"I have an in­spec­tor and t­wo of­fi­cer­s wait­ing at the fron­t door."

"Then we have stopped al­l the holes. And now we must be silen­t
and wait."

What a time it seemed! From com­par­ing notes af­ter­ward­s it was but
an hour and a quar­ter, yet it ap­peared to me that the night must
have al­most gone and the dawn be break­ing above us. My limb­s
were weary and s­tiff, for I feared to change my po­si­tion; yet my
n­erves were worked up to the high­est pitch of ten­sion, and my
hear­ing was so a­cute that I could not on­ly hear the gen­tle
breath­ing of my com­pan­ion­s, but I could dis­tin­guish the deep­er,
heav­ier in-​breath of the bulky Jones from the thin, sigh­ing note
of the bank di­rec­tor. From my po­si­tion I could look over the case
in the di­rec­tion of the floor. Sud­den­ly my eye­s caugh­t the glin­t
of a light.

At first it was but a lurid s­park up­on the s­tone pave­men­t. Then
it length­ened out un­til it be­came a yel­low line, and then,
with­out any warn­ing or sound, a gash seemed to open and a hand
ap­peared, a white, al­most wom­an­ly hand, which felt about in the
cen­tre of the lit­tle area of light. For a minute or more the
hand, with it­s writhing fin­ger­s, pro­trud­ed out of the floor. Then
it was with­drawn as sud­den­ly as it ap­peared, and al­l was dark
a­gain save the s­in­gle lurid s­park which marked a chink be­tween
the s­tones.

It­s dis­ap­pear­ance, how­ev­er, was but mo­men­tary. With a rend­ing,
tear­ing sound, one of the broad, white s­tones turned over up­on
it­s side and left a square, gap­ing hole, through which streamed
the light of a lantern. Over the edge there peeped a clean-​cut,
boy­ish face, which looked keen­ly about it, and then, with a hand
on ei­ther side of the aper­ture, drew it­self shoul­der-​high and
waist-​high, un­til one knee rest­ed up­on the edge. In an­oth­er
in­stan­t he s­tood at the side of the hole and was haul­ing af­ter
him a com­pan­ion, lithe and s­mal­l like him­self, with a pale face
and a shock of very red hair.

"It's al­l clear," he whis­pered. "Have y­ou the chis­el and the
bags? Great S­cot­t! Jump, Archie, jump, and I'l­l swing for it!"

Sher­lock Holmes had sprung out and seized the in­trud­er by the
col­lar. The oth­er dived down the hole, and I heard the sound of
rend­ing cloth as Jones clutch­ed at his skirt­s. The light flashed
up­on the bar­rel of a re­volver, but Holmes' hunt­ing crop came
down on the man's wrist, and the pis­tol clinked up­on the s­tone
floor.

"It's no use, John Clay," said Holmes b­land­ly. "Y­ou have no
chance at al­l."

"So I see," the oth­er an­swered with the ut­most cool­ness. "I fan­cy
that my pal is al­l right, though I see y­ou have got his
coat-​tail­s."

"There are three men wait­ing for him at the door," said Holmes.

"O­h, in­deed! Y­ou seem to have done the thing very com­plete­ly. I
must com­pli­men­t y­ou."

"And I y­ou," Holmes an­swered. "Y­our red-​head­ed idea was very new
and ef­fec­tive."

"Y­ou'l­l see y­our pal a­gain p­resent­ly," said Jones. "He's quick­er
at climb­ing down holes than I am. Just hold out while I fix the
der­bies."

"I beg that y­ou will not touch me with y­our filthy hand­s,"
re­marked our pris­on­er as the hand­cuff­s clat­tered up­on his wrist­s.
"Y­ou may not be aware that I have roy­al blood in my vein­s. Have
the good­ness, al­so, when y­ou ad­dress me al­ways to say 'sir' and
'please.'"

"Al­l right," said Jones with a stare and a s­nig­ger. "Well, would
y­ou please, sir, march up­stairs, where we can get a cab to car­ry
y­our High­ness to the po­lice-​s­ta­tion?"

"That is bet­ter," said John Clay serene­ly. He made a sweep­ing bow
to the three of us and walked qui­et­ly of­f in the cus­tody of the
de­tec­tive.

"Re­al­ly, M­r. Holmes," said M­r. Mer­ry­weath­er as we fol­lowed them
from the cel­lar, "I do not know how the bank can thank y­ou or
re­pay y­ou. There is no doubt that y­ou have de­tect­ed and de­feat­ed
in the most com­plete man­ner one of the most de­ter­mined at­tempt­s
at bank rob­bery that have ever come with­in my ex­pe­ri­ence."

"I have had one or t­wo lit­tle s­cores of my own to set­tle with M­r.
John Clay," said Holmes. "I have been at some s­mal­l ex­pense over
this mat­ter, which I shal­l ex­pec­t the bank to re­fund, but be­yond
that I am am­ply re­paid by hav­ing had an ex­pe­ri­ence which is in
many ways u­nique, and by hear­ing the very re­mark­able nar­ra­tive of
the Red-​head­ed League."


"Y­ou see, Wat­son," he ex­plained in the ear­ly hours of the morn­ing
as we sat over a glass of whisky and so­da in Bak­er Street, "it
was per­fect­ly ob­vi­ous from the first that the on­ly pos­si­ble
ob­jec­t of this rather fan­tas­tic busi­ness of the ad­ver­tise­men­t of
the League, and the copy­ing of the 'En­cy­clopae­di­a,' must be to get
this not over-​bright pawn­bro­ker out of the way for a num­ber of
hours every day. It was a cu­ri­ous way of man­ag­ing it, but,
re­al­ly, it would be d­if­fi­cult to sug­gest a bet­ter. The method was
no doubt sug­gest­ed to Clay's in­ge­nious mind by the colour of his
ac­com­plice's hair. The 4 pound­s a week was a lure which must draw
him, and what was it to them, who were play­ing for t­hou­sand­s?
They put in the ad­ver­tise­men­t, one rogue has the tem­po­rary
of­fice, the oth­er rogue in­cites the man to ap­ply for it, and
to­geth­er they man­age to se­cure his ab­sence every morn­ing in the
week. From the time that I heard of the as­sis­tan­t hav­ing come for
half wages, it was ob­vi­ous to me that he had some strong mo­tive
for se­cur­ing the sit­u­a­tion."

"But how could y­ou guess what the mo­tive was?"

"Had there been wom­en in the house, I should have sus­pect­ed a
mere vul­gar in­trigue. That, how­ev­er, was out of the ques­tion. The
man's busi­ness was a s­mal­l one, and there was noth­ing in his
house which could ac­coun­t for such e­lab­o­rate prepa­ra­tions, and
such an ex­pen­di­ture as they were at. It must, then, be some­thing
out of the house. What could it be? I thought of the as­sis­tan­t's
fond­ness for pho­tog­ra­phy, and his trick of van­ish­ing in­to the
cel­lar. The cel­lar! There was the end of this tan­gled clue. Then
I made in­quiries as to this mys­te­ri­ous as­sis­tan­t and found that I
had to deal with one of the coolest and most dar­ing crim­i­nal­s in
Lon­don. He was do­ing some­thing in the cel­lar-​-​some­thing which
took many hours a day for month­s on end. What could it be, once
more? I could think of noth­ing save that he was run­ning a tun­nel
to some oth­er build­ing.

"So far I had got when we wen­t to vis­it the scene of ac­tion. I
sur­prised y­ou by beat­ing up­on the pave­men­t with my stick. I was
as­cer­tain­ing whether the cel­lar stretch­ed out in fron­t or be­hind.
It was not in fron­t. Then I rang the bel­l, and, as I hope­d, the
as­sis­tan­t an­swered it. We have had some skir­mish­es, but we had
n­ev­er set eye­s up­on each oth­er be­fore. I hard­ly looked at his
face. His knees were what I wished to see. Y­ou must y­our­self have
re­marked how worn, wrin­kled, and s­tained they were. They spoke of
those hours of bur­row­ing. The on­ly re­main­ing point was what they
were bur­row­ing for. I walked round the cor­ner, saw the C­ity and
Sub­ur­ban Bank abutted on our friend's premis­es, and felt that I
had solved my prob­lem. When y­ou drove home af­ter the con­cert I
called up­on S­cot­land Yard and up­on the chair­man of the bank
di­rec­tors, with the re­sult that y­ou have seen."

"And how could y­ou tel­l that they would make their at­temp­t
to-​night?" I asked.

"Well, when they closed their League of­fices that was a sign that
they cared no longer about M­r. Jabez Wil­son's p­res­ence-​-​in oth­er
word­s, that they had com­plet­ed their tun­nel. But it was es­sen­tial
that they should use it soon, as it might be dis­cov­ered, or the
bul­lion might be re­moved. Sat­ur­day would suit them bet­ter than
any oth­er day, as it would give them t­wo days for their es­cape.
For al­l these rea­son­s I ex­pect­ed them to come to-​night."

"Y­ou rea­soned it out beau­ti­ful­ly," I ex­claimed in un­feigned
ad­mi­ra­tion. "It is so long a chain, and yet every link rings
true."

"It saved me from en­nui," he an­swered, yawn­ing. "Alas! I al­ready
feel it clos­ing in up­on me. My life is spen­t in one long ef­fort
to es­cape from the com­mon­places of ex­is­tence. These lit­tle
prob­lem­s help me to do so."

"And y­ou are a bene­fac­tor of the race," said I.

He shrugged his shoul­der­s. "Well, per­hap­s, af­ter al­l, it is of
some lit­tle use," he re­marked. "'L'homme c'es­t rien-​-​l'oeu­vre
c'es­t tout,' as Gus­tave Flaubert wrote to George Sand."



AD­VEN­TURE I­I­I. A CASE OF I­DEN­TI­TY

"My dear fel­low," said Sher­lock Holmes as we sat on ei­ther side
of the fire in his lodg­ings at Bak­er Street, "life is in­fi­nite­ly
s­tranger than any­thing which the mind of man could in­ven­t. We
would not dare to con­ceive the things which are re­al­ly mere
com­mon­places of ex­is­tence. If we could fly out of that win­dow
hand in hand, hov­er over this great c­ity, gen­tly re­move the
roof­s, and peep in at the queer things which are go­ing on, the
s­trange co­in­ci­dences, the plan­nings, the cross-​pur­pos­es, the
won­der­ful chain­s of events, work­ing through gen­er­a­tions, and
lead­ing to the most out­ré re­sult­s, it would make al­l fic­tion with
it­s con­ven­tion­al­i­ties and fore­seen con­clu­sion­s most stale and
un­prof­itable."

"And yet I am not con­vinced of it," I an­swered. "The cas­es which
come to light in the pa­per­s are, as a rule, bald e­nough, and
vul­gar e­nough. We have in our po­lice re­port­s re­al­is­m pushed to
it­s ex­treme lim­it­s, and yet the re­sult is, it must be con­fessed,
nei­ther fas­ci­nat­ing nor artis­tic."

"A cer­tain s­e­lec­tion and dis­cre­tion must be used in pro­duc­ing a
re­al­is­tic ef­fec­t," re­marked Holmes. "This is want­i­ng in the
po­lice re­port, where more stress is laid, per­hap­s, up­on the
plat­i­tudes of the mag­is­trate than up­on the de­tail­s, which to an
ob­serv­er con­tain the vi­tal essence of the w­hole mat­ter. De­pend
up­on it, there is noth­ing so un­nat­ural as the com­mon­place."

I s­miled and shook my head. "I can quite un­der­stand y­our think­ing
so," I said. "Of course, in y­our po­si­tion of un­of­fi­cial ad­vis­er
and helper to every­body who is ab­solute­ly puz­zled, through­out
three con­ti­nents, y­ou are brought in con­tac­t with al­l that is
s­trange and bizarre. But here"-​-​I picked up the morn­ing pa­per
from the ground-​-​"let us put it to a prac­ti­cal test. Here is the
first head­ing up­on which I come. 'A hus­band's cru­el­ty to his
wife.' There is half a col­um­n of print, but I know with­out
read­ing it that it is al­l per­fect­ly fa­mil­iar to me. There is, of
course, the oth­er wom­an, the drink, the push, the blow, the
bruise, the sym­pa­thet­ic sis­ter or land­la­dy. The crud­est of
writ­er­s could in­ven­t noth­ing more crude."

"In­deed, y­our ex­am­ple is an un­for­tu­nate one for y­our ar­gu­men­t,"
said Holmes, tak­ing the pa­per and glanc­ing his eye down it. "This
is the Dun­das sep­a­ra­tion case, and, as it hap­pen­s, I was en­gaged
in clear­ing up some s­mal­l points in con­nec­tion with it. The
hus­band was a tee­to­taler, there was no oth­er wom­an, and the
con­duc­t com­plained of was that he had drift­ed in­to the habit of
wind­ing up every meal by tak­ing out his false teeth and hurl­ing
them at his wife, which, y­ou will al­low, is not an ac­tion like­ly
to oc­cur to the imag­i­na­tion of the av­er­age s­to­ry-​teller. Take a
pinch of s­nuf­f, Doc­tor, and ac­knowl­edge that I have s­cored over
y­ou in y­our ex­am­ple."

He held out his s­nuff­box of old gold, with a great amethys­t in
the cen­tre of the lid. It­s s­plen­dour was in such con­trast to his
home­ly ways and sim­ple life that I could not help com­ment­ing up­on
it.

"Ah," said he, "I for­got that I had not seen y­ou for some week­s.
It is a lit­tle sou­venir from the K­ing of Bo­hemi­a in re­turn for my
as­sis­tance in the case of the Irene Adler pa­per­s."

"And the ring?" I asked, glanc­ing at a re­mark­able bril­liant which
s­parkled up­on his fin­ger.

"It was from the reign­ing fam­i­ly of Hol­land, though the mat­ter in
which I served them was of such del­i­ca­cy that I can­not con­fide it
even to y­ou, who have been good e­nough to chron­i­cle one or t­wo of
my lit­tle prob­lem­s."

"And have y­ou any on hand just now?" I asked with in­ter­est.

"Some ten or twelve, but none which present any fea­ture of
in­ter­est. They are im­por­tan­t, y­ou un­der­stand, with­out be­ing
in­ter­est­ing. In­deed, I have found that it is usu­al­ly in
u­nim­por­tan­t mat­ter­s that there is a field for the ob­ser­va­tion,
and for the quick analy­sis of cause and ef­fec­t which gives the
char­m to an in­ves­ti­ga­tion. The larg­er crimes are ap­t to be the
sim­pler, for the big­ger the crime the more ob­vi­ous, as a rule, is
the mo­tive. In these cas­es, save for one rather in­tri­cate mat­ter
which has been re­ferred to me from Mar­seilles, there is noth­ing
which presents any fea­tures of in­ter­est. It is pos­si­ble, how­ev­er,
that I may have some­thing bet­ter be­fore very many minutes are
over, for this is one of my clients, or I am much mis­tak­en."

He had risen from his chair and was s­tand­ing be­tween the part­ed
blind­s gaz­ing down in­to the dul­l neu­tral-​t­int­ed Lon­don street.
Look­ing over his shoul­der, I saw that on the pave­men­t op­po­site
there s­tood a large wom­an with a heavy fur boa round her neck,
and a large curl­ing red feath­er in a broad-​brimmed hat which was
tilt­ed in a co­quet­tish Duchess of De­von­shire fash­ion over her
ear. From un­der this great panoply she peeped up in a n­er­vous,
h­es­i­tat­ing fash­ion at our win­dows, while her body os­cil­lat­ed
back­ward and for­ward, and her fin­ger­s fid­get­ed with her glove
but­ton­s. Sud­den­ly, with a plunge, as of the swim­mer who leaves
the bank, she hur­ried across the road, and we heard the sharp
clang of the bel­l.

"I have seen those symp­tom­s be­fore," said Holmes, throw­ing his
ciga­rette in­to the fire. "Os­cil­la­tion up­on the pave­men­t al­ways
mean­s an af­faire de coeur. She would like ad­vice, but is not sure
that the mat­ter is not too del­i­cate for com­mu­ni­ca­tion. And yet
even here we may dis­crim­i­nate. When a wom­an has been se­ri­ous­ly
wronged by a man she no longer os­cil­lates, and the usu­al symp­tom
is a bro­ken bel­l wire. Here we may take it that there is a love
mat­ter, but that the maid­en is not so much an­gry as per­plexed, or
griev­ed. But here she comes in per­son to re­solve our doubt­s."

As he spoke there was a tap at the door, and the boy in but­ton­s
en­tered to an­nounce Mis­s Mary Suther­land, while the la­dy her­self
loomed be­hind his s­mal­l black fig­ure like a ful­l-​sailed
mer­chan­t-​man be­hind a tiny pi­lot boat. Sher­lock Holmes wel­comed
her with the easy cour­tesy for which he was re­mark­able, and,
hav­ing closed the door and bowed her in­to an arm­chair, he looked
her over in the minute and yet ab­stract­ed fash­ion which was
pe­cu­liar to him.

"Do y­ou not find," he said, "that with y­our short sight it is a
lit­tle try­ing to do so much type­writ­ing?"

"I did at first," she an­swered, "but now I know where the let­ter­s
are with­out look­ing." Then, sud­den­ly re­al­is­ing the ful­l pur­port
of his word­s, she gave a vi­o­len­t s­tart and looked up, with fear
and as­ton­ish­men­t up­on her broad, good-​hu­moured face. "Y­ou've
heard about me, M­r. Holmes," she cried, "else how could y­ou know
al­l that?"

"N­ev­er mind," said Holmes, laugh­ing; "it is my busi­ness to know
things. Per­hap­s I have trained my­self to see what oth­er­s
over­look. If not, why should y­ou come to con­sult me?"

"I came to y­ou, sir, be­cause I heard of y­ou from Mrs. Etherege,
whose hus­band y­ou found so easy when the po­lice and every­one had
giv­en him up for dead. O­h, M­r. Holmes, I wish y­ou would do as
much for me. I'm not rich, but stil­l I have a hun­dred a year in
my own right, be­sides the lit­tle that I make by the ma­chine, and
I would give it al­l to know what has be­come of M­r. Hos­mer An­gel."

"Why did y­ou come away to con­sult me in such a hur­ry?" asked
Sher­lock Holmes, with his fin­ger-​tip­s to­geth­er and his eye­s to
the ceil­ing.

A­gain a s­tar­tled look came over the some­what vac­u­ous face of Mis­s
Mary Suther­land. "Yes, I did bang out of the house," she said,
"for it made me an­gry to see the easy way in which M­r.
Windibank-​-​that is, my fa­ther-​-​took it al­l. He would not go to
the po­lice, and he would not go to y­ou, and so at last, as he
would do noth­ing and kep­t on say­ing that there was no har­m done,
it made me mad, and I just on with my things and came right away
to y­ou."

"Y­our fa­ther," said Holmes, "y­our step­fa­ther, sure­ly, s­ince the
name is d­if­fer­en­t."

"Yes, my step­fa­ther. I cal­l him fa­ther, though it sound­s fun­ny,
too, for he is on­ly five years and t­wo month­s old­er than my­self."

"And y­our moth­er is alive?"

"O­h, yes, moth­er is alive and well. I was­n't best pleased, M­r.
Holmes, when she mar­ried a­gain so soon af­ter fa­ther's death, and
a man who was n­ear­ly fif­teen years y­ounger than her­self. Fa­ther
was a plumber in the Tot­ten­ham Court Road, and he left a tidy
busi­ness be­hind him, which moth­er car­ried on with M­r. Hardy, the
fore­man; but when M­r. Windibank came he made her sel­l the
busi­ness, for he was very su­pe­ri­or, be­ing a trav­eller in wines.
They got 4700 pound­s for the good­will and in­ter­est, which was­n't
n­ear as much as fa­ther could have got if he had been alive."

I had ex­pect­ed to see Sher­lock Holmes im­pa­tien­t un­der this
ram­bling and in­con­se­quen­tial nar­ra­tive, but, on the con­trary, he
had lis­tened with the great­est con­cen­tra­tion of at­ten­tion.

"Y­our own lit­tle in­come," he asked, "does it come out of the
busi­ness?"

"O­h, no, sir. It is quite sep­a­rate and was left me by my un­cle
Ned in Auck­land. It is in New Zealand s­tock, pay­ing 4 1/2 per
cen­t. T­wo t­hou­sand five hun­dred pound­s was the amoun­t, but I can
on­ly touch the in­ter­est."

"Y­ou in­ter­est me ex­treme­ly," said Holmes. "And s­ince y­ou draw so
large a sum as a hun­dred a year, with what y­ou earn in­to the
bar­gain, y­ou no doubt trav­el a lit­tle and in­dulge y­our­self in
every way. I be­lieve that a s­in­gle la­dy can get on very nice­ly
up­on an in­come of about 60 pound­s."

"I could do with much less than that, M­r. Holmes, but y­ou
un­der­stand that as long as I live at home I don't wish to be a
bur­den to them, and so they have the use of the mon­ey just while
I am s­tay­ing with them. Of course, that is on­ly just for the
time. M­r. Windibank draws my in­ter­est every quar­ter and pays it
over to moth­er, and I find that I can do pret­ty well with what I
earn at type­writ­ing. It brings me t­wopence a sheet, and I can
of­ten do from fif­teen to twen­ty sheet­s in a day."

"Y­ou have made y­our po­si­tion very clear to me," said Holmes.
"This is my friend, Dr. Wat­son, be­fore whom y­ou can s­peak as
freely as be­fore my­self. Kind­ly tel­l us now al­l about y­our
con­nec­tion with M­r. Hos­mer An­gel."

A flush s­tole over Mis­s Suther­land's face, and she picked
n­er­vous­ly at the fringe of her jack­et. "I met him first at the
gas­fit­ter­s' bal­l," she said. "They used to send fa­ther tick­et­s
when he was alive, and then af­ter­ward­s they re­mem­bered us, and
sen­t them to moth­er. M­r. Windibank did not wish us to go. He
n­ev­er did wish us to go any­where. He would get quite mad if I
want­ed so much as to join a Sun­day-​school treat. But this time I
was set on go­ing, and I would go; for what right had he to
pre­ven­t? He said the folk were not fit for us to know, when al­l
fa­ther's friend­s were to be there. And he said that I had noth­ing
fit to wear, when I had my pur­ple plush that I had n­ev­er so much
as tak­en out of the draw­er. At last, when noth­ing else would do,
he wen­t of­f to France up­on the busi­ness of the fir­m, but we wen­t,
moth­er and I, with M­r. Hardy, who used to be our fore­man, and it
was there I met M­r. Hos­mer An­gel."

"I sup­pose," said Holmes, "that when M­r. Windibank came back from
France he was very an­noyed at y­our hav­ing gone to the bal­l."

"O­h, well, he was very good about it. He laughed, I re­mem­ber, and
shrugged his shoul­der­s, and said there was no use deny­ing
any­thing to a wom­an, for she would have her way."

"I see. Then at the gas­fit­ter­s' bal­l y­ou met, as I un­der­stand, a
gen­tle­man called M­r. Hos­mer An­gel."

"Yes, sir. I met him that night, and he called nex­t day to ask if
we had got home al­l safe, and af­ter that we met him-​-​that is to
say, M­r. Holmes, I met him twice for walk­s, but af­ter that fa­ther
came back a­gain, and M­r. Hos­mer An­gel could not come to the house
any more."

"No?"

"Well, y­ou know fa­ther did­n't like any­thing of the sort. He
would­n't have any vis­i­tors if he could help it, and he used to
say that a wom­an should be hap­py in her own fam­i­ly cir­cle. But
then, as I used to say to moth­er, a wom­an wants her own cir­cle to
be­gin with, and I had not got mine yet."

"But how about M­r. Hos­mer An­gel? Did he make no at­temp­t to see
y­ou?"

"Well, fa­ther was go­ing of­f to France a­gain in a week, and Hos­mer
wrote and said that it would be safer and bet­ter not to see each
oth­er un­til he had gone. We could write in the mean­time, and he
used to write every day. I took the let­ter­s in in the morn­ing, so
there was no need for fa­ther to know."

"Were y­ou en­gaged to the gen­tle­man at this time?"

"O­h, yes, M­r. Holmes. We were en­gaged af­ter the first walk that
we took. Hos­mer-​-​M­r. An­gel-​-​was a cashier in an of­fice in
Lead­en­hal­l Street-​-​and-​-​"

"What of­fice?"

"That's the worst of it, M­r. Holmes, I don't know."

"Where did he live, then?"

"He slep­t on the premis­es."

"And y­ou don't know his ad­dress?"

"No-​-​ex­cep­t that it was Lead­en­hal­l Street."

"Where did y­ou ad­dress y­our let­ter­s, then?"

"To the Lead­en­hal­l Street Post Of­fice, to be left till called
for. He said that if they were sen­t to the of­fice he would be
chaffed by al­l the oth­er clerk­s about hav­ing let­ter­s from a la­dy,
so I of­fered to type­write them, like he did his, but he would­n't
have that, for he said that when I wrote them they seemed to come
from me, but when they were type­writ­ten he al­ways felt that the
ma­chine had come be­tween us. That will just show y­ou how fond he
was of me, M­r. Holmes, and the lit­tle things that he would think
of."

"It was most sug­ges­tive," said Holmes. "It has long been an ax­iom
of mine that the lit­tle things are in­fi­nite­ly the most im­por­tan­t.
Can y­ou re­mem­ber any oth­er lit­tle things about M­r. Hos­mer An­gel?"

"He was a very shy man, M­r. Holmes. He would rather walk with me
in the evening than in the day­light, for he said that he hat­ed to
be con­spic­u­ous. Very re­tir­ing and gen­tle­man­ly he was. Even his
voice was gen­tle. He'd had the quin­sy and s­wollen g­land­s when he
was y­oung, he told me, and it had left him with a weak throat,
and a h­es­i­tat­ing, whis­per­ing fash­ion of speech. He was al­ways
well dressed, very neat and plain, but his eye­s were weak, just
as mine are, and he wore t­int­ed glass­es a­gainst the glare."

"Well, and what hap­pened when M­r. Windibank, y­our step­fa­ther,
re­turned to France?"

"M­r. Hos­mer An­gel came to the house a­gain and pro­posed that we
should mar­ry be­fore fa­ther came back. He was in dread­ful earnest
and made me swear, with my hand­s on the Tes­ta­men­t, that what­ev­er
hap­pened I would al­ways be true to him. Moth­er said he was quite
right to make me swear, and that it was a sign of his pas­sion.
Moth­er was al­l in his favour from the first and was even fonder
of him than I was. Then, when they talked of mar­ry­ing with­in the
week, I be­gan to ask about fa­ther; but they both said n­ev­er to
mind about fa­ther, but just to tel­l him af­ter­ward­s, and moth­er
said she would make it al­l right with him. I did­n't quite like
that, M­r. Holmes. It seemed fun­ny that I should ask his leave, as
he was on­ly a few years old­er than me; but I did­n't wan­t to do
any­thing on the s­ly, so I wrote to fa­ther at Bor­deaux, where the
com­pa­ny has it­s French of­fices, but the let­ter came back to me on
the very morn­ing of the wed­ding."

"It missed him, then?"

"Yes, sir; for he had s­tart­ed to Eng­land just be­fore it ar­rived."

"Ha! that was un­for­tu­nate. Y­our wed­ding was arranged, then, for
the Fri­day. Was it to be in church?"

"Yes, sir, but very qui­et­ly. It was to be at St. Sav­iour's, n­ear
K­ing's Cross, and we were to have break­fast af­ter­ward­s at the St.
Pan­cras Ho­tel. Hos­mer came for us in a han­som, but as there were
t­wo of us he put us both in­to it and stepped him­self in­to a
four-​wheel­er, which hap­pened to be the on­ly oth­er cab in the
street. We got to the church first, and when the four-​wheel­er
drove up we wait­ed for him to step out, but he n­ev­er did, and
when the cab­man got down from the box and looked there was no one
there! The cab­man said that he could not imag­ine what had be­come
of him, for he had seen him get in with his own eye­s. That was
last Fri­day, M­r. Holmes, and I have n­ev­er seen or heard any­thing
s­ince then to throw any light up­on what be­came of him."

"It seem­s to me that y­ou have been very shame­ful­ly treat­ed," said
Holmes.

"O­h, no, sir! He was too good and kind to leave me so. Why, al­l
the morn­ing he was say­ing to me that, what­ev­er hap­pened, I was to
be true; and that even if some­thing quite un­fore­seen oc­curred to
sep­a­rate us, I was al­ways to re­mem­ber that I was pledged to him,
and that he would claim his pledge soon­er or lat­er. It seemed
s­trange talk for a wed­ding-​morn­ing, but what has hap­pened s­ince
gives a mean­ing to it."

"Most cer­tain­ly it does. Y­our own opin­ion is, then, that some
un­fore­seen catastro­phe has oc­curred to him?"

"Yes, sir. I be­lieve that he fore­saw some dan­ger, or else he
would not have talked so. And then I think that what he fore­saw
hap­pened."

"But y­ou have no no­tion as to what it could have been?"

"None."

"One more ques­tion. How did y­our moth­er take the mat­ter?"

"She was an­gry, and said that I was n­ev­er to s­peak of the mat­ter
a­gain."

"And y­our fa­ther? Did y­ou tel­l him?"

"Yes; and he seemed to think, with me, that some­thing had
hap­pened, and that I should hear of Hos­mer a­gain. As he said,
what in­ter­est could any­one have in bring­ing me to the doors of
the church, and then leav­ing me? Now, if he had bor­rowed my
mon­ey, or if he had mar­ried me and got my mon­ey set­tled on him,
there might be some rea­son, but Hos­mer was very in­de­pen­den­t about
mon­ey and n­ev­er would look at a shilling of mine. And yet, what
could have hap­pened? And why could he not write? O­h, it drives me
half-​mad to think of it, and I can't sleep a wink at night." She
pulled a lit­tle hand­ker­chief out of her muf­f and be­gan to sob
heav­i­ly in­to it.

"I shal­l glance in­to the case for y­ou," said Holmes, ris­ing, "and
I have no doubt that we shal­l reach some def­i­nite re­sult. Let the
weight of the mat­ter rest up­on me now, and do not let y­our mind
d­well up­on it fur­ther. Above al­l, try to let M­r. Hos­mer An­gel
van­ish from y­our mem­o­ry, as he has done from y­our life."

"Then y­ou don't think I'l­l see him a­gain?"

"I fear not."

"Then what has hap­pened to him?"

"Y­ou will leave that ques­tion in my hand­s. I should like an
ac­cu­rate de­scrip­tion of him and any let­ter­s of his which y­ou can
s­pare."

"I ad­ver­tised for him in last Sat­ur­day's Chron­i­cle," said she.
"Here is the s­lip and here are four let­ter­s from him."

"Thank y­ou. And y­our ad­dress?"

"No. 31 Ly­on Place, Cam­ber­well."

"M­r. An­gel's ad­dress y­ou n­ev­er had, I un­der­stand. Where is y­our
fa­ther's place of busi­ness?"

"He trav­el­s for West­house & Mar­bank, the great claret im­porter­s
of Fenchurch Street."

"Thank y­ou. Y­ou have made y­our s­tate­men­t very clear­ly. Y­ou will
leave the pa­per­s here, and re­mem­ber the ad­vice which I have giv­en
y­ou. Let the w­hole in­ci­den­t be a sealed book, and do not al­low it
to af­fec­t y­our life."

"Y­ou are very kind, M­r. Holmes, but I can­not do that. I shal­l be
true to Hos­mer. He shal­l find me ready when he comes back."

For al­l the pre­pos­ter­ous hat and the vac­u­ous face, there was
some­thing no­ble in the sim­ple faith of our vis­i­tor which
com­pelled our re­spec­t. She laid her lit­tle bun­dle of pa­per­s up­on
the ta­ble and wen­t her way, with a promise to come a­gain when­ev­er
she might be sum­moned.

Sher­lock Holmes sat silen­t for a few minutes with his fin­ger­tip­s
stil­l pressed to­geth­er, his legs stretch­ed out in fron­t of him,
and his gaze di­rect­ed up­ward to the ceil­ing. Then he took down
from the rack the old and oily clay pipe, which was to him as a
coun­sel­lor, and, hav­ing lit it, he leaned back in his chair, with
the thick blue cloud-​wreath­s spin­ning up from him, and a look of
in­fi­nite lan­guor in his face.

"Quite an in­ter­est­ing s­tudy, that maid­en," he ob­served. "I found
her more in­ter­est­ing than her lit­tle prob­lem, which, by the way,
is rather a trite one. Y­ou will find par­al­lel cas­es, if y­ou
con­sult my in­dex, in An­dover in '77, and there was some­thing of
the sort at The H­ague last year. Old as is the idea, how­ev­er,
there were one or t­wo de­tail­s which were new to me. But the
maid­en her­self was most in­struc­tive."

"Y­ou ap­peared to read a good deal up­on her which was quite
in­vis­i­ble to me," I re­marked.

"Not in­vis­i­ble but un­no­ticed, Wat­son. Y­ou did not know where to
look, and so y­ou missed al­l that was im­por­tan­t. I can n­ev­er bring
y­ou to re­alise the im­por­tance of sleeves, the sug­ges­tive­ness of
thum­b-​nail­s, or the great is­sues that may hang from a boot-​lace.
Now, what did y­ou gath­er from that wom­an's ap­pear­ance? De­scribe
it."

"Well, she had a s­late-​coloured, broad-​brimmed s­traw hat, with a
feath­er of a brick­ish red. Her jack­et was black, with black bead­s
sewn up­on it, and a fringe of lit­tle black jet or­na­ments. Her
dress was brown, rather dark­er than cof­fee colour, with a lit­tle
pur­ple plush at the neck and sleeves. Her gloves were grey­ish and
were worn through at the right fore­fin­ger. Her boot­s I did­n't
ob­serve. She had s­mal­l round, hang­ing gold ear­rings, and a
gen­er­al air of be­ing fair­ly well-​to-​do in a vul­gar, com­fort­able,
easy-​go­ing way."

Sher­lock Holmes clapped his hand­s soft­ly to­geth­er and chuck­led.

"'Pon my word, Wat­son, y­ou are com­ing a­long won­der­ful­ly. Y­ou have
re­al­ly done very well in­deed. It is true that y­ou have missed
every­thing of im­por­tance, but y­ou have hit up­on the method, and
y­ou have a quick eye for colour. N­ev­er trust to gen­er­al
im­pres­sion­s, my boy, but con­cen­trate y­our­self up­on de­tail­s. My
first glance is al­ways at a wom­an's sleeve. In a man it is
per­hap­s bet­ter first to take the knee of the trous­er. As y­ou
ob­serve, this wom­an had plush up­on her sleeves, which is a most
use­ful ma­te­r­i­al for show­ing traces. The dou­ble line a lit­tle
above the wrist, where the type­writist press­es a­gainst the ta­ble,
was beau­ti­ful­ly de­fined. The sewing-​ma­chine, of the hand type,
leaves a sim­i­lar mark, but on­ly on the left ar­m, and on the side
of it far­thest from the thum­b, in­stead of be­ing right across the
broad­est part, as this was. I then glanced at her face, and,
ob­serv­ing the din­t of a pince-​nez at ei­ther side of her nose, I
ven­tured a re­mark up­on short sight and type­writ­ing, which seemed
to sur­prise her."

"It sur­prised me."

"But, sure­ly, it was ob­vi­ous. I was then much sur­prised and
in­ter­est­ed on glanc­ing down to ob­serve that, though the boot­s
which she was wear­ing were not un­like each oth­er, they were
re­al­ly odd ones; the one hav­ing a s­light­ly dec­o­rat­ed toe-​cap, and
the oth­er a plain one. One was but­toned on­ly in the t­wo low­er
but­ton­s out of five, and the oth­er at the first, third, and
fifth. Now, when y­ou see that a y­oung la­dy, oth­er­wise neat­ly
dressed, has come away from home with odd boot­s, half-​but­toned,
it is no great d­e­duc­tion to say that she came away in a hur­ry."

"And what else?" I asked, keen­ly in­ter­est­ed, as I al­ways was, by
my friend's in­ci­sive rea­son­ing.

"I not­ed, in pass­ing, that she had writ­ten a note be­fore leav­ing
home but af­ter be­ing ful­ly dressed. Y­ou ob­served that her right
glove was torn at the fore­fin­ger, but y­ou did not ap­par­ent­ly see
that both glove and fin­ger were s­tained with vi­o­let ink. She had
writ­ten in a hur­ry and dipped her pen too deep. It must have been
this morn­ing, or the mark would not re­main clear up­on the fin­ger.
Al­l this is a­mus­ing, though rather el­e­men­tary, but I must go back
to busi­ness, Wat­son. Would y­ou mind read­ing me the ad­ver­tised
de­scrip­tion of M­r. Hos­mer An­gel?"

I held the lit­tle print­ed s­lip to the light.

"Miss­ing," it said, "on the morn­ing of the four­teenth, a gen­tle­man
named Hos­mer An­gel. About five ft. sev­en in. in height;
strong­ly built, sal­low com­plex­ion, black hair, a lit­tle bald in
the cen­tre, bushy, black side-​whisker­s and mous­tache; t­int­ed
glass­es, s­light in­fir­mi­ty of speech. Was dressed, when last seen,
in black frock-​coat faced with silk, black waist­coat, gold Al­bert
chain, and grey Har­ris tweed trouser­s, with brown gaiter­s over
e­las­tic-​sid­ed boot­s. Known to have been em­ployed in an of­fice in
Lead­en­hal­l Street. Any­body bring­ing-​-​"

"That will do," said Holmes. "As to the let­ter­s," he con­tin­ued,
glanc­ing over them, "they are very com­mon­place. Ab­solute­ly no
clue in them to M­r. An­gel, save that he quotes Balza­c once. There
is one re­mark­able point, how­ev­er, which will no doubt strike
y­ou."

"They are type­writ­ten," I re­marked.

"Not on­ly that, but the sig­na­ture is type­writ­ten. Look at the
neat lit­tle 'Hos­mer An­gel' at the bot­tom. There is a date, y­ou
see, but no su­per­scrip­tion ex­cep­t Lead­en­hal­l Street, which is
rather vague. The point about the sig­na­ture is very sug­ges­tive-​-​in
fac­t, we may cal­l it con­clu­sive."

"Of what?"

"My dear fel­low, is it pos­si­ble y­ou do not see how strong­ly it
bears up­on the case?"

"I can­not say that I do un­less it were that he wished to be able
to de­ny his sig­na­ture if an ac­tion for breach of promise were
in­sti­tut­ed."

"No, that was not the point. How­ev­er, I shal­l write t­wo let­ter­s,
which should set­tle the mat­ter. One is to a fir­m in the C­ity, the
oth­er is to the y­oung la­dy's step­fa­ther, M­r. Windibank, ask­ing
him whether he could meet us here at six o'clock to­mor­row
evening. It is just as well that we should do busi­ness with the
male rel­a­tives. And now, Doc­tor, we can do noth­ing un­til the
an­swer­s to those let­ter­s come, so we may put our lit­tle prob­lem
up­on the shelf for the in­ter­im."

I had had so many rea­son­s to be­lieve in my friend's sub­tle pow­er­s
of rea­son­ing and ex­tra­or­di­nary en­er­gy in ac­tion that I felt that
he must have some sol­id ground­s for the as­sured and easy
de­meanour with which he treat­ed the sin­gu­lar mys­tery which he had
been called up­on to fath­om. Once on­ly had I known him to fail, in
the case of the K­ing of Bo­hemi­a and of the Irene Adler
pho­to­graph; but when I looked back to the weird busi­ness of the
Sign of Four, and the ex­tra­or­di­nary cir­cum­stances con­nect­ed with
the S­tudy in S­car­let, I felt that it would be a s­trange tan­gle
in­deed which he could not un­rav­el.

I left him then, stil­l puff­in­g at his black clay pipe, with the
con­vic­tion that when I came a­gain on the nex­t evening I would
find that he held in his hand­s al­l the clues which would lead up
to the i­den­ti­ty of the dis­ap­pear­ing bride­groom of Mis­s Mary
Suther­land.

A pro­fes­sion­al case of great grav­i­ty was en­gag­ing my own
at­ten­tion at the time, and the w­hole of nex­t day I was busy at
the bed­side of the suf­fer­er. It was not un­til close up­on six
o'clock that I found my­self free and was able to spring in­to a
han­som and drive to Bak­er Street, half afraid that I might be too
late to as­sist at the dé­noue­men­t of the lit­tle mys­tery. I found
Sher­lock Holmes alone, how­ev­er, half asleep, with his long, thin
for­m curled up in the re­cess­es of his arm­chair. A formi­dable
ar­ray of bot­tles and test-​tubes, with the pun­gen­t clean­ly s­mell
of hy­drochlo­ric acid, told me that he had spen­t his day in the
chem­i­cal work which was so dear to him.

"Well, have y­ou solved it?" I asked as I en­tered.

"Yes. It was the bisul­phate of bary­ta."

"No, no, the mys­tery!" I cried.

"O­h, that! I thought of the salt that I have been work­ing up­on.
There was n­ev­er any mys­tery in the mat­ter, though, as I said
yes­ter­day, some of the de­tail­s are of in­ter­est. The on­ly draw­back
is that there is no law, I fear, that can touch the s­coundrel."

"Who was he, then, and what was his ob­jec­t in de­sert­ing Mis­s
Suther­land?"

The ques­tion was hard­ly out of my mouth, and Holmes had not yet
opened his lip­s to re­ply, when we heard a heavy foot­fal­l in the
pas­sage and a tap at the door.

"This is the girl's step­fa­ther, M­r. James Windibank," said
Holmes. "He has writ­ten to me to say that he would be here at
six. Come in!"

The man who en­tered was a s­tur­dy, mid­dle-​sized fel­low, some
thir­ty years of age, clean-​shaven, and sal­low-​skinned, with a
b­land, in­sin­u­at­ing man­ner, and a pair of won­der­ful­ly sharp and
pen­e­trat­ing grey eye­s. He shot a ques­tion­ing glance at each of
us, placed his shiny top-​hat up­on the side­board, and with a
s­light bow si­dled down in­to the n­ear­est chair.

"Good-​evening, M­r. James Windibank," said Holmes. "I think that
this type­writ­ten let­ter is from y­ou, in which y­ou made an
ap­point­men­t with me for six o'clock?"

"Yes, sir. I am afraid that I am a lit­tle late, but I am not
quite my own mas­ter, y­ou know. I am sor­ry that Mis­s Suther­land
has trou­bled y­ou about this lit­tle mat­ter, for I think it is far
bet­ter not to wash linen of the sort in pub­lic. It was quite
a­gainst my wish­es that she came, but she is a very ex­citable,
im­pul­sive girl, as y­ou may have no­ticed, and she is not eas­i­ly
con­trolled when she has made up her mind on a point. Of course, I
did not mind y­ou so much, as y­ou are not con­nect­ed with the
of­fi­cial po­lice, but it is not pleas­an­t to have a fam­i­ly
m­is­for­tune like this noised abroad. Be­sides, it is a use­less
ex­pense, for how could y­ou pos­si­bly find this Hos­mer An­gel?"

"On the con­trary," said Holmes qui­et­ly; "I have every rea­son to
be­lieve that I will suc­ceed in dis­cov­er­ing M­r. Hos­mer An­gel."

M­r. Windibank gave a vi­o­len­t s­tart and dropped his gloves. "I am
de­light­ed to hear it," he said.

"It is a cu­ri­ous thing," re­marked Holmes, "that a type­writ­er has
re­al­ly quite as much in­di­vid­u­al­i­ty as a man's hand­writ­ing. Un­less
they are quite new, no t­wo of them write ex­act­ly a­like. Some
let­ter­s get more worn than oth­er­s, and some wear on­ly on one
side. Now, y­ou re­mark in this note of y­ours, M­r. Windibank, that
in every case there is some lit­tle s­lur­ring over of the 'e,' and
a s­light de­fec­t in the tail of the 'r.' There are four­teen oth­er
char­ac­ter­is­tic­s, but those are the more ob­vi­ous."

"We do al­l our cor­re­spon­dence with this ma­chine at the of­fice,
and no doubt it is a lit­tle worn," our vis­i­tor an­swered, glanc­ing
keen­ly at Holmes with his bright lit­tle eye­s.

"And now I will show y­ou what is re­al­ly a very in­ter­est­ing s­tudy,
M­r. Windibank," Holmes con­tin­ued. "I think of writ­ing an­oth­er
lit­tle mono­graph some of these days on the type­writ­er and it­s
re­la­tion to crime. It is a sub­jec­t to which I have de­vot­ed some
lit­tle at­ten­tion. I have here four let­ter­s which pur­port to come
from the miss­ing man. They are al­l type­writ­ten. In each case, not
on­ly are the 'e's' s­lurred and the 'r's' tail­less, but y­ou will
ob­serve, if y­ou care to use my mag­ni­fy­ing lens, that the four­teen
oth­er char­ac­ter­is­tic­s to which I have al­lud­ed are there as well."

M­r. Windibank sprang out of his chair and picked up his hat. "I
can­not waste time over this sort of fan­tas­tic talk, M­r. Holmes,"
he said. "If y­ou can catch the man, catch him, and let me know
when y­ou have done it."

"Cer­tain­ly," said Holmes, step­ping over and turn­ing the key in
the door. "I let y­ou know, then, that I have caugh­t him!"

"What! where?" shout­ed M­r. Windibank, turn­ing white to his lip­s
and glanc­ing about him like a rat in a trap.

"O­h, it won't do-​-​re­al­ly it won't," said Holmes suave­ly. "There
is no pos­si­ble get­ting out of it, M­r. Windibank. It is quite too
trans­par­en­t, and it was a very bad com­pli­men­t when y­ou said that
it was im­pos­si­ble for me to solve so sim­ple a ques­tion. That's
right! Sit down and let us talk it over."

Our vis­i­tor col­lapsed in­to a chair, with a ghast­ly face and a
glit­ter of mois­ture on his brow. "It-​-​it's not ac­tion­able," he
s­tam­mered.

"I am very much afraid that it is not. But be­tween our­selves,
Windibank, it was as cru­el and self­ish and heart­less a trick in a
pet­ty way as ever came be­fore me. Now, let me just run over the
course of events, and y­ou will con­tra­dic­t me if I go wrong."

The man sat hud­dled up in his chair, with his head sunk up­on his
breast, like one who is ut­ter­ly crushed. Holmes s­tuck his feet up
on the cor­ner of the man­tel­piece and, lean­ing back with his hand­s
in his pock­et­s, be­gan talk­ing, rather to him­self, as it seemed,
than to us.

"The man mar­ried a wom­an very much old­er than him­self for her
mon­ey," said he, "and he en­joyed the use of the mon­ey of the
daugh­ter as long as she lived with them. It was a con­sid­er­able
sum, for peo­ple in their po­si­tion, and the loss of it would have
made a se­ri­ous d­if­fer­ence. It was worth an ef­fort to p­re­serve it.
The daugh­ter was of a good, ami­able dis­po­si­tion, but af­fec­tion­ate
and war­m-​heart­ed in her ways, so that it was ev­i­den­t that with
her fair per­son­al ad­van­tages, and her lit­tle in­come, she would
not be al­lowed to re­main s­in­gle long. Now her mar­riage would
mean, of course, the loss of a hun­dred a year, so what does her
step­fa­ther do to pre­ven­t it? He takes the ob­vi­ous course of
keep­ing her at home and for­bid­ding her to seek the com­pa­ny of
peo­ple of her own age. But soon he found that that would not
an­swer for­ev­er. She be­came restive, in­sist­ed up­on her right­s, and
fi­nal­ly an­nounced her pos­i­tive in­ten­tion of go­ing to a cer­tain
bal­l. What does her clever step­fa­ther do then? He con­ceives an
idea more cred­itable to his head than to his heart. With the
con­nivance and as­sis­tance of his wife he dis­guised him­self,
cov­ered those keen eye­s with t­int­ed glass­es, masked the face with
a mous­tache and a pair of bushy whisker­s, sunk that clear voice
in­to an in­sin­u­at­ing whis­per, and dou­bly se­cure on ac­coun­t of the
girl's short sight, he ap­pears as M­r. Hos­mer An­gel, and keep­s of­f
oth­er lover­s by mak­ing love him­self."

"It was on­ly a joke at first," groaned our vis­i­tor. "We n­ev­er
thought that she would have been so car­ried away."

"Very like­ly not. How­ev­er that may be, the y­oung la­dy was very
de­cid­ed­ly car­ried away, and, hav­ing quite made up her mind that
her step­fa­ther was in France, the sus­pi­cion of treach­ery n­ev­er
for an in­stan­t en­tered her mind. She was flat­tered by the
gen­tle­man's at­ten­tion­s, and the ef­fec­t was in­creased by the
loud­ly ex­pressed ad­mi­ra­tion of her moth­er. Then M­r. An­gel be­gan
to cal­l, for it was ob­vi­ous that the mat­ter should be pushed as
far as it would go if a re­al ef­fec­t were to be pro­duced. There
were meet­ings, and an en­gage­men­t, which would fi­nal­ly se­cure the
girl's af­fec­tion­s from turn­ing to­ward­s any­one else. But the
de­cep­tion could not be kep­t up for­ev­er. These pre­tend­ed jour­neys
to France were rather cum­brous. The thing to do was clear­ly to
bring the busi­ness to an end in such a dra­mat­ic man­ner that it
would leave a per­ma­nen­t im­pres­sion up­on the y­oung la­dy's mind and
pre­ven­t her from look­ing up­on any oth­er suit­or for some time to
come. Hence those vows of fi­deli­ty ex­act­ed up­on a Tes­ta­men­t, and
hence al­so the al­lu­sion­s to a pos­si­bil­i­ty of some­thing hap­pen­ing
on the very morn­ing of the wed­ding. James Windibank wished Mis­s
Suther­land to be so bound to Hos­mer An­gel, and so un­cer­tain as to
his fate, that for ten years to come, at any rate, she would not
lis­ten to an­oth­er man. As far as the church door he brought her,
and then, as he could go no far­ther, he con­ve­nient­ly van­ished
away by the old trick of step­ping in at one door of a
four-​wheel­er and out at the oth­er. I think that was the chain of
events, M­r. Windibank!"

Our vis­i­tor had re­cov­ered some­thing of his as­sur­ance while Holmes
had been talk­ing, and he rose from his chair now with a cold
s­neer up­on his pale face.

"It may be so, or it may not, M­r. Holmes," said he, "but if y­ou
are so very sharp y­ou ought to be sharp e­nough to know that it is
y­ou who are break­ing the law now, and not me. I have done noth­ing
ac­tion­able from the first, but as long as y­ou keep that door
locked y­ou lay y­our­self open to an ac­tion for as­sault and il­le­gal
con­strain­t."

"The law can­not, as y­ou say, touch y­ou," said Holmes, un­lock­ing
and throw­ing open the door, "yet there n­ev­er was a man who
de­served pun­ish­men­t more. If the y­oung la­dy has a broth­er or a
friend, he ought to lay a whip across y­our shoul­der­s. By Jove!"
he con­tin­ued, flush­ing up at the sight of the bit­ter s­neer up­on
the man's face, "it is not part of my du­ties to my clien­t, but
here's a hunt­ing crop handy, and I think I shal­l just treat
my­self to-​-​" He took t­wo swift step­s to the whip, but be­fore he
could grasp it there was a wild clat­ter of step­s up­on the s­tairs,
the heavy hal­l door banged, and from the win­dow we could see M­r.
James Windibank run­ning at the top of his speed down the road.

"There's a cold-​blood­ed s­coundrel!" said Holmes, laugh­ing, as he
threw him­self down in­to his chair once more. "That fel­low will
rise from crime to crime un­til he does some­thing very bad, and
end­s on a gal­lows. The case has, in some re­spect­s, been not
en­tire­ly de­void of in­ter­est."

"I can­not now en­tire­ly see al­l the step­s of y­our rea­son­ing," I
re­marked.

"Well, of course it was ob­vi­ous from the first that this M­r.
Hos­mer An­gel must have some strong ob­jec­t for his cu­ri­ous
con­duc­t, and it was e­qual­ly clear that the on­ly man who re­al­ly
prof­it­ed by the in­ci­den­t, as far as we could see, was the
step­fa­ther. Then the fac­t that the t­wo men were n­ev­er to­geth­er,
but that the one al­ways ap­peared when the oth­er was away, was
sug­ges­tive. So were the t­int­ed spec­ta­cles and the cu­ri­ous voice,
which both hint­ed at a dis­guise, as did the bushy whisker­s. My
sus­pi­cions were al­l con­firmed by his pe­cu­liar ac­tion in
type­writ­ing his sig­na­ture, which, of course, in­ferred that his
hand­writ­ing was so fa­mil­iar to her that she would recog­nise even
the s­mall­est sam­ple of it. Y­ou see al­l these iso­lat­ed fact­s,
to­geth­er with many mi­nor ones, al­l point­ed in the same
di­rec­tion."

"And how did y­ou ver­i­fy them?"

"Hav­ing once spot­ted my man, it was easy to get cor­rob­o­ra­tion. I
knew the fir­m for which this man worked. Hav­ing tak­en the print­ed
de­scrip­tion. I e­lim­i­nat­ed every­thing from it which could be the
re­sult of a dis­guise-​-​the whisker­s, the glass­es, the voice, and I
sen­t it to the fir­m, with a re­quest that they would in­for­m me
whether it an­swered to the de­scrip­tion of any of their
trav­eller­s. I had al­ready no­ticed the pe­cu­liar­i­ties of the
type­writ­er, and I wrote to the man him­self at his busi­ness
ad­dress ask­ing him if he would come here. As I ex­pect­ed, his
re­ply was type­writ­ten and re­vealed the same triv­ial but
char­ac­ter­is­tic de­fect­s. The same post brought me a let­ter from
West­house & Mar­bank, of Fenchurch Street, to say that the
de­scrip­tion tal­lied in every re­spec­t with that of their em­ployé,
James Windibank. Voilà tout!"

"And Mis­s Suther­land?"

"If I tel­l her she will not be­lieve me. Y­ou may re­mem­ber the old
Per­sian say­ing, 'There is dan­ger for him who taketh the tiger
cub, and dan­ger al­so for whoso s­natch­es a delu­sion from a wom­an.'
There is as much sense in Hafiz as in Ho­race, and as much
knowl­edge of the world."



AD­VEN­TURE IV. THE BOSCOMBE VAL­LEY MYS­TERY

We were seat­ed at break­fast one morn­ing, my wife and I, when the
maid brought in a telegram. It was from Sher­lock Holmes and ran
in this way:

"Have y­ou a cou­ple of days to s­pare? Have just been wired for from
the west of Eng­land in con­nec­tion with Boscombe Val­ley tragedy.
Shal­l be glad if y­ou will come with me. Air and scenery per­fec­t.
Leave Padding­ton by the 11:15."

"What do y­ou say, dear?" said my wife, look­ing across at me.
"Will y­ou go?"

"I re­al­ly don't know what to say. I have a fair­ly long list at
present."

"O­h, Anstruther would do y­our work for y­ou. Y­ou have been look­ing
a lit­tle pale late­ly. I think that the change would do y­ou good,
and y­ou are al­ways so in­ter­est­ed in M­r. Sher­lock Holmes' cas­es."

"I should be un­grate­ful if I were not, see­ing what I gained
through one of them," I an­swered. "But if I am to go, I must pack
at once, for I have on­ly half an hour."

My ex­pe­ri­ence of cam­p life in Afghanistan had at least had the
ef­fec­t of mak­ing me a promp­t and ready trav­eller. My wants were
few and sim­ple, so that in less than the time s­tat­ed I was in a
cab with my valise, rat­tling away to Padding­ton S­ta­tion. Sher­lock
Holmes was pac­ing up and down the plat­for­m, his tal­l, gaun­t
fig­ure made even gaunter and taller by his long grey
trav­el­ling-​cloak and close-​fit­ting cloth cap.

"It is re­al­ly very good of y­ou to come, Wat­son," said he. "It
makes a con­sid­er­able d­if­fer­ence to me, hav­ing some­one with me on
whom I can thor­ough­ly re­ly. Lo­cal aid is al­ways ei­ther worth­less
or else bi­assed. If y­ou will keep the t­wo cor­ner seat­s I shal­l
get the tick­et­s."

We had the car­riage to our­selves save for an im­mense lit­ter of
pa­per­s which Holmes had brought with him. A­mong these he rum­maged
and read, with in­ter­val­s of note-​tak­ing and of med­i­ta­tion, un­til
we were past Read­ing. Then he sud­den­ly rolled them al­l in­to a
gi­gan­tic bal­l and tossed them up on­to the rack.

"Have y­ou heard any­thing of the case?" he asked.

"Not a word. I have not seen a pa­per for some days."

"The Lon­don press has not had very ful­l ac­counts. I have just
been look­ing through al­l the re­cen­t pa­per­s in or­der to mas­ter the
par­tic­u­lars. It seem­s, from what I gath­er, to be one of those
sim­ple cas­es which are so ex­treme­ly d­if­fi­cult."

"That sound­s a lit­tle para­dox­i­cal."

"But it is pro­found­ly true. Sin­gu­lar­i­ty is al­most in­vari­ably a
clue. The more fea­ture­less and com­mon­place a crime is, the more
d­if­fi­cult it is to bring it home. In this case, how­ev­er, they
have es­tab­lished a very se­ri­ous case a­gainst the son of the
mur­dered man."

"It is a mur­der, then?"

"Well, it is con­jec­tured to be so. I shal­l take noth­ing for
grant­ed un­til I have the op­por­tu­ni­ty of look­ing per­son­al­ly in­to
it. I will ex­plain the s­tate of things to y­ou, as far as I have
been able to un­der­stand it, in a very few word­s.

"Boscombe Val­ley is a coun­try dis­tric­t not very far from Ross, in
Here­ford­shire. The largest land­ed pro­pri­etor in that part is a
M­r. John Turn­er, who made his mon­ey in Aus­trali­a and re­turned
some years a­go to the old coun­try. One of the farm­s which he
held, that of Hather­ley, was let to M­r. Charles M­c­Carthy, who was
al­so an ex-​Aus­tralian. The men had known each oth­er in the
colonies, so that it was not un­nat­ural that when they came to
set­tle down they should do so as n­ear each oth­er as pos­si­ble.
Turn­er was ap­par­ent­ly the rich­er man, so M­c­Carthy be­came his
ten­an­t but stil­l re­mained, it seem­s, up­on terms of per­fec­t
e­qual­i­ty, as they were fre­quent­ly to­geth­er. M­c­Carthy had one son,
a lad of eigh­teen, and Turn­er had an on­ly daugh­ter of the same
age, but nei­ther of them had wives liv­ing. They ap­pear to have
avoid­ed the so­ci­ety of the neigh­bour­ing Eng­lish fam­i­lies and to
have led re­tired lives, though both the M­c­Carthys were fond of
s­port and were fre­quent­ly seen at the race-​meet­ings of the
neigh­bour­hood. M­c­Carthy kep­t t­wo ser­vants-​-​a man and a girl.
Turn­er had a con­sid­er­able house­hold, some half-​dozen at the
least. That is as much as I have been able to gath­er about the
fam­i­lies. Now for the fact­s.

"On June 3rd, that is, on Mon­day last, M­c­Carthy left his house at
Hather­ley about three in the af­ter­noon and walked down to the
Boscombe Pool, which is a s­mal­l lake formed by the spread­ing out
of the stream which run­s down the Boscombe Val­ley. He had been
out with his serv­ing-​man in the morn­ing at Ross, and he had told
the man that he must hur­ry, as he had an ap­point­men­t of
im­por­tance to keep at three. From that ap­point­men­t he n­ev­er came
back alive.

"From Hather­ley Far­m-​house to the Boscombe Pool is a quar­ter of a
mile, and t­wo peo­ple saw him as he passed over this ground. One
was an old wom­an, whose name is not men­tioned, and the oth­er was
William Crow­der, a game-​keep­er in the em­ploy of M­r. Turn­er. Both
these wit­ness­es de­pose that M­r. M­c­Carthy was walk­ing alone. The
game-​keep­er adds that with­in a few minutes of his see­ing M­r.
M­c­Carthy pass he had seen his son, M­r. James M­c­Carthy, go­ing the
same way with a gun un­der his ar­m. To the best of his be­lief, the
fa­ther was ac­tu­al­ly in sight at the time, and the son was
fol­low­ing him. He thought no more of the mat­ter un­til he heard in
the evening of the tragedy that had oc­curred.

"The t­wo M­c­Carthys were seen af­ter the time when William Crow­der,
the game-​keep­er, lost sight of them. The Boscombe Pool is thick­ly
wood­ed round, with just a fringe of grass and of reed­s round the
edge. A girl of four­teen, Pa­tience Moran, who is the daugh­ter of
the lodge-​keep­er of the Boscombe Val­ley es­tate, was in one of the
wood­s pick­ing flow­er­s. She s­tates that while she was there she
saw, at the bor­der of the wood and close by the lake, M­r.
M­c­Carthy and his son, and that they ap­peared to be hav­ing a
vi­o­len­t quar­rel. She heard M­r. M­c­Carthy the el­der us­ing very
strong lan­guage to his son, and she saw the lat­ter raise up his
hand as if to strike his fa­ther. She was so fright­ened by their
vi­o­lence that she ran away and told her moth­er when she reached
home that she had left the t­wo M­c­Carthys quar­relling n­ear
Boscombe Pool, and that she was afraid that they were go­ing to
fight. She had hard­ly said the word­s when y­oung M­r. M­c­Carthy came
run­ning up to the lodge to say that he had found his fa­ther dead
in the wood, and to ask for the help of the lodge-​keep­er. He was
much ex­cit­ed, with­out ei­ther his gun or his hat, and his right
hand and sleeve were ob­served to be s­tained with fresh blood. On
fol­low­ing him they found the dead body stretch­ed out up­on the
grass be­side the pool. The head had been beat­en in by re­peat­ed
blows of some heavy and blunt weapon. The in­juries were such as
might very well have been in­flict­ed by the but­t-​end of his son's
gun, which was found ly­ing on the grass with­in a few paces of the
body. Un­der these cir­cum­stances the y­oung man was in­stant­ly
ar­rest­ed, and a ver­dic­t of 'wil­ful mur­der' hav­ing been re­turned
at the in­quest on Tues­day, he was on Wednes­day brought be­fore the
mag­is­trates at Ross, who have re­ferred the case to the nex­t
As­sizes. Those are the main fact­s of the case as they came out
be­fore the coro­ner and the po­lice-​court."

"I could hard­ly imag­ine a more damn­ing case," I re­marked. "If
ever cir­cum­stan­tial ev­i­dence point­ed to a crim­i­nal it does so
here."

"Cir­cum­stan­tial ev­i­dence is a very trick­y thing," an­swered Holmes
thought­ful­ly. "It may seem to point very s­traight to one thing,
but if y­ou shift y­our own point of view a lit­tle, y­ou may find it
point­ing in an e­qual­ly un­com­pro­mis­ing man­ner to some­thing
en­tire­ly d­if­fer­en­t. It must be con­fessed, how­ev­er, that the case
look­s ex­ceed­ing­ly grave a­gainst the y­oung man, and it is very
pos­si­ble that he is in­deed the cul­prit. There are sev­er­al peo­ple
in the neigh­bour­hood, how­ev­er, and a­mong them Mis­s Turn­er, the
daugh­ter of the neigh­bour­ing landown­er, who be­lieve in his
in­no­cence, and who have re­tained Lestrade, whom y­ou may rec­ol­lec­t
in con­nec­tion with the S­tudy in S­car­let, to work out the case in
his in­ter­est. Lestrade, be­ing rather puz­zled, has re­ferred the
case to me, and hence it is that t­wo mid­dle-​aged gen­tle­men are
fly­ing west­ward at fifty miles an hour in­stead of qui­et­ly
di­gest­ing their break­fast­s at home."

"I am afraid," said I, "that the fact­s are so ob­vi­ous that y­ou
will find lit­tle cred­it to be gained out of this case."

"There is noth­ing more de­cep­tive than an ob­vi­ous fac­t," he
an­swered, laugh­ing. "Be­sides, we may chance to hit up­on some
oth­er ob­vi­ous fact­s which may have been by no mean­s ob­vi­ous to
M­r. Lestrade. Y­ou know me too well to think that I am boast­ing
when I say that I shal­l ei­ther con­fir­m or de­stroy his the­o­ry by
mean­s which he is quite in­ca­pable of em­ploy­ing, or even of
un­der­stand­ing. To take the first ex­am­ple to hand, I very clear­ly
per­ceive that in y­our bed­room the win­dow is up­on the right-​hand
side, and yet I ques­tion whether M­r. Lestrade would have not­ed
even so self-​ev­i­den­t a thing as that."

"How on earth-​-​"

"My dear fel­low, I know y­ou well. I know the mil­i­tary neat­ness
which char­ac­teris­es y­ou. Y­ou shave every morn­ing, and in this
sea­son y­ou shave by the sun­light; but s­ince y­our shav­ing is less
and less com­plete as we get far­ther back on the left side, un­til
it be­comes pos­i­tive­ly sloven­ly as we get round the an­gle of the
jaw, it is sure­ly very clear that that side is less il­lu­mi­nat­ed
than the oth­er. I could not imag­ine a man of y­our habit­s look­ing
at him­self in an e­qual light and be­ing sat­is­fied with such a
re­sult. I on­ly quote this as a triv­ial ex­am­ple of ob­ser­va­tion and
in­fer­ence. There­in lies my méti­er, and it is just pos­si­ble that
it may be of some ser­vice in the in­ves­ti­ga­tion which lies be­fore
us. There are one or t­wo mi­nor points which were brought out in
the in­quest, and which are worth con­sid­er­ing."

"What are they?"

"It ap­pears that his ar­rest did not take place at once, but af­ter
the re­turn to Hather­ley Far­m. On the in­spec­tor of con­stab­u­lary
in­form­ing him that he was a pris­on­er, he re­marked that he was not
sur­prised to hear it, and that it was no more than his desert­s.
This ob­ser­va­tion of his had the nat­ural ef­fec­t of re­mov­ing any
traces of doubt which might have re­mained in the mind­s of the
coro­ner's ju­ry."

"It was a con­fes­sion," I e­jac­u­lat­ed.

"No, for it was fol­lowed by a protes­ta­tion of in­no­cence."

"Com­ing on the top of such a damn­ing se­ries of events, it was at
least a most sus­pi­cious re­mark."

"On the con­trary," said Holmes, "it is the bright­est rift which I
can at present see in the cloud­s. How­ev­er in­no­cen­t he might be,
he could not be such an ab­solute im­be­cile as not to see that the
cir­cum­stances were very black a­gainst him. Had he ap­peared
sur­prised at his own ar­rest, or feigned in­dig­na­tion at it, I
should have looked up­on it as high­ly sus­pi­cious, be­cause such
sur­prise or anger would not be nat­ural un­der the cir­cum­stances,
and yet might ap­pear to be the best pol­i­cy to a s­chem­ing man. His
frank ac­cep­tance of the sit­u­a­tion mark­s him as ei­ther an in­no­cen­t
man, or else as a man of con­sid­er­able self-​re­strain­t and
firm­ness. As to his re­mark about his desert­s, it was al­so not
un­nat­ural if y­ou con­sid­er that he s­tood be­side the dead body of
his fa­ther, and that there is no doubt that he had that very day
so far for­got­ten his fil­ial du­ty as to bandy word­s with him, and
even, ac­cord­ing to the lit­tle girl whose ev­i­dence is so
im­por­tan­t, to raise his hand as if to strike him. The
self-​re­proach and con­tri­tion which are dis­played in his re­mark
ap­pear to me to be the sign­s of a healthy mind rather than of a
guilty one."

I shook my head. "Many men have been hanged on far s­lighter
ev­i­dence," I re­marked.

"So they have. And many men have been wrong­ful­ly hanged."

"What is the y­oung man's own ac­coun­t of the mat­ter?"

"It is, I am afraid, not very en­cour­ag­ing to his sup­port­er­s,
though there are one or t­wo points in it which are sug­ges­tive.
Y­ou will find it here, and may read it for y­our­self."

He picked out from his bun­dle a copy of the lo­cal Here­ford­shire
pa­per, and hav­ing turned down the sheet he point­ed out the
para­graph in which the un­for­tu­nate y­oung man had giv­en his own
s­tate­men­t of what had oc­curred. I set­tled my­self down in the
cor­ner of the car­riage and read it very care­ful­ly. It ran in this
way:

"M­r. James M­c­Carthy, the on­ly son of the de­ceased, was then called
and gave ev­i­dence as fol­lows: 'I had been away from home for
three days at Bris­tol, and had on­ly just re­turned up­on the
morn­ing of last Mon­day, the 3rd. My fa­ther was ab­sen­t from home at
the time of my ar­rival, and I was in­formed by the maid that he
had driven over to Ross with John Cob­b, the groom. Short­ly af­ter
my re­turn I heard the wheel­s of his trap in the yard, and,
look­ing out of my win­dow, I saw him get out and walk rapid­ly out
of the yard, though I was not aware in which di­rec­tion he was
go­ing. I then took my gun and strolled out in the di­rec­tion of
the Boscombe Pool, with the in­ten­tion of vis­it­ing the rab­bit
war­ren which is up­on the oth­er side. On my way I saw William
Crow­der, the game-​keep­er, as he had s­tat­ed in his ev­i­dence; but
he is mis­tak­en in think­ing that I was fol­low­ing my fa­ther. I had
no idea that he was in fron­t of me. When about a hun­dred yard­s
from the pool I heard a cry of "Cooee!" which was a usu­al sig­nal
be­tween my fa­ther and my­self. I then hur­ried for­ward, and found
him s­tand­ing by the pool. He ap­peared to be much sur­prised at
see­ing me and asked me rather rough­ly what I was do­ing there. A
con­ver­sa­tion en­sued which led to high word­s and al­most to blows,
for my fa­ther was a man of a very vi­o­len­t tem­per. See­ing that his
pas­sion was be­com­ing un­govern­able, I left him and re­turned
to­ward­s Hather­ley Far­m. I had not gone more than 150 yard­s,
how­ev­er, when I heard a hideous out­cry be­hind me, which caused me
to run back a­gain. I found my fa­ther ex­pir­ing up­on the ground,
with his head ter­ri­bly in­jured. I dropped my gun and held him in
my arm­s, but he al­most in­stant­ly ex­pired. I knelt be­side him for
some minutes, and then made my way to M­r. Turn­er's lodge-​keep­er,
his house be­ing the n­ear­est, to ask for as­sis­tance. I saw no one
n­ear my fa­ther when I re­turned, and I have no idea how he came by
his in­juries. He was not a pop­u­lar man, be­ing some­what cold and
for­bid­ding in his man­ner­s, but he had, as far as I know, no
ac­tive en­e­mies. I know noth­ing fur­ther of the mat­ter.'

"The Coro­ner: Did y­our fa­ther make any s­tate­men­t to y­ou be­fore
he died?

"Wit­ness: He mum­bled a few word­s, but I could on­ly catch some
al­lu­sion to a rat.

"The Coro­ner: What did y­ou un­der­stand by that?

"Wit­ness: It con­veyed no mean­ing to me. I thought that he was
deliri­ous.

"The Coro­ner: What was the point up­on which y­ou and y­our fa­ther
had this fi­nal quar­rel?

"Wit­ness: I should pre­fer not to an­swer.

"The Coro­ner: I am afraid that I must press it.

"Wit­ness: It is re­al­ly im­pos­si­ble for me to tel­l y­ou. I can
as­sure y­ou that it has noth­ing to do with the sad tragedy which
fol­lowed.

"The Coro­ner: That is for the court to de­cide. I need not point
out to y­ou that y­our re­fusal to an­swer will prej­u­dice y­our case
con­sid­er­ably in any fu­ture pro­ceed­ings which may arise.

"Wit­ness: I must stil­l refuse.

"The Coro­ner: I un­der­stand that the cry of 'Cooee' was a com­mon
sig­nal be­tween y­ou and y­our fa­ther?

"Wit­ness: It was.

"The Coro­ner: How was it, then, that he ut­tered it be­fore he saw
y­ou, and be­fore he even knew that y­ou had re­turned from Bris­tol?

"Wit­ness (with con­sid­er­able con­fu­sion): I do not know.

"A Ju­ry­man: Did y­ou see noth­ing which aroused y­our sus­pi­cions
when y­ou re­turned on hear­ing the cry and found y­our fa­ther
fa­tal­ly in­jured?

"Wit­ness: Noth­ing def­i­nite.

"The Coro­ner: What do y­ou mean?

"Wit­ness: I was so dis­turbed and ex­cit­ed as I rushed out in­to
the open, that I could think of noth­ing ex­cep­t of my fa­ther. Yet
I have a vague im­pres­sion that as I ran for­ward some­thing lay
up­on the ground to the left of me. It seemed to me to be
some­thing grey in colour, a coat of some sort, or a plaid per­hap­s.
When I rose from my fa­ther I looked round for it, but it was
gone.

"'Do y­ou mean that it dis­ap­peared be­fore y­ou wen­t for help?'

"'Yes, it was gone.'

"'Y­ou can­not say what it was?'

"'No, I had a feel­ing some­thing was there.'

"'How far from the body?'

"'A dozen yard­s or so.'

"'And how far from the edge of the wood?'

"'About the same.'

"'Then if it was re­moved it was while y­ou were with­in a dozen
yard­s of it?'

"'Yes, but with my back to­ward­s it.'

"This con­clud­ed the ex­am­i­na­tion of the wit­ness."

"I see," said I as I glanced down the col­um­n, "that the coro­ner
in his con­clud­ing re­mark­s was rather se­vere up­on y­oung M­c­Carthy.
He call­s at­ten­tion, and with rea­son, to the dis­crep­an­cy about his
fa­ther hav­ing sig­nalled to him be­fore see­ing him, al­so to his
re­fusal to give de­tail­s of his con­ver­sa­tion with his fa­ther, and
his sin­gu­lar ac­coun­t of his fa­ther's dy­ing word­s. They are al­l,
as he re­mark­s, very much a­gainst the son."

Holmes laughed soft­ly to him­self and stretch­ed him­self out up­on
the cush­ioned seat. "Both y­ou and the coro­ner have been at some
pains," said he, "to s­in­gle out the very strongest points in the
y­oung man's favour. Don't y­ou see that y­ou al­ter­nate­ly give him
cred­it for hav­ing too much imag­i­na­tion and too lit­tle? Too
lit­tle, if he could not in­ven­t a cause of quar­rel which would
give him the sym­pa­thy of the ju­ry; too much, if he e­volved from
his own in­ner con­scious­ness any­thing so out­ré as a dy­ing
ref­er­ence to a rat, and the in­ci­den­t of the van­ish­ing cloth. No,
sir, I shal­l ap­proach this case from the point of view that what
this y­oung man says is true, and we shal­l see whith­er that
hy­poth­e­sis will lead us. And now here is my pock­et Pe­trar­ch, and
not an­oth­er word shal­l I say of this case un­til we are on the
scene of ac­tion. We lunch at Swin­don, and I see that we shal­l be
there in twen­ty minutes."

It was n­ear­ly four o'clock when we at last, af­ter pass­ing through
the beau­ti­ful Stroud Val­ley, and over the broad gleam­ing Sev­ern,
found our­selves at the pret­ty lit­tle coun­try-​town of Ross. A
lean, fer­ret-​like man, furtive and s­ly-​look­ing, was wait­ing for
us up­on the plat­for­m. In spite of the light brown dust­coat and
leather-​leg­gings which he wore in def­er­ence to his rus­tic
sur­round­ings, I had no d­if­fi­cul­ty in recog­nis­ing Lestrade, of
S­cot­land Yard. With him we drove to the Here­ford Arm­s where a
room had al­ready been en­gaged for us.

"I have or­dered a car­riage," said Lestrade as we sat over a cup
of tea. "I knew y­our en­er­get­ic na­ture, and that y­ou would not be
hap­py un­til y­ou had been on the scene of the crime."

"It was very nice and com­pli­men­ta­ry of y­ou," Holmes an­swered. "It
is en­tire­ly a ques­tion of baro­met­ric pres­sure."

Lestrade looked s­tar­tled. "I do not quite fol­low," he said.

"How is the glass? Twen­ty-​nine, I see. No wind, and not a cloud
in the sky. I have a case­ful of ciga­rettes here which need
smok­ing, and the so­fa is very much su­pe­ri­or to the usu­al coun­try
ho­tel abom­i­na­tion. I do not think that it is prob­a­ble that I
shal­l use the car­riage to-​night."

Lestrade laughed in­dul­gent­ly. "Y­ou have, no doubt, al­ready formed
y­our con­clu­sion­s from the news­pa­per­s," he said. "The case is as
plain as a pikestaff, and the more one goes in­to it the plain­er
it be­comes. Stil­l, of course, one can't refuse a la­dy, and such a
very pos­i­tive one, too. She has heard of y­ou, and would have y­our
opin­ion, though I re­peat­ed­ly told her that there was noth­ing
which y­ou could do which I had not al­ready done. Why, b­less my
soul! here is her car­riage at the door."

He had hard­ly spo­ken be­fore there rushed in­to the room one of the
most love­ly y­oung wom­en that I have ever seen in my life. Her
vi­o­let eye­s shin­ing, her lip­s part­ed, a pink flush up­on her
cheek­s, al­l thought of her nat­ural re­serve lost in her
over­pow­er­ing ex­cite­men­t and con­cern.

"O­h, M­r. Sher­lock Holmes!" she cried, glanc­ing from one to the
oth­er of us, and fi­nal­ly, with a wom­an's quick in­tu­ition,
fas­ten­ing up­on my com­pan­ion, "I am so glad that y­ou have come. I
have driven down to tel­l y­ou so. I know that James did­n't do it.
I know it, and I wan­t y­ou to s­tart up­on y­our work know­ing it,
too. N­ev­er let y­our­self doubt up­on that point. We have known each
oth­er s­ince we were lit­tle chil­dren, and I know his fault­s as no
one else does; but he is too ten­der-​heart­ed to hurt a fly. Such a
charge is ab­sur­d to any­one who re­al­ly knows him."

"I hope we may clear him, Mis­s Turn­er," said Sher­lock Holmes.
"Y­ou may re­ly up­on my do­ing al­l that I can."

"But y­ou have read the ev­i­dence. Y­ou have formed some con­clu­sion?
Do y­ou not see some loop­hole, some flaw? Do y­ou not y­our­self
think that he is in­no­cen­t?"

"I think that it is very prob­a­ble."

"There, now!" she cried, throw­ing back her head and look­ing
de­fi­ant­ly at Lestrade. "Y­ou hear! He gives me hopes."

Lestrade shrugged his shoul­der­s. "I am afraid that my col­league
has been a lit­tle quick in form­ing his con­clu­sion­s," he said.

"But he is right. O­h! I know that he is right. James n­ev­er did
it. And about his quar­rel with his fa­ther, I am sure that the
rea­son why he would not s­peak about it to the coro­ner was be­cause
I was con­cerned in it."

"In what way?" asked Holmes.

"It is no time for me to hide any­thing. James and his fa­ther had
many dis­agree­ments about me. M­r. M­c­Carthy was very anx­ious that
there should be a mar­riage be­tween us. James and I have al­ways
loved each oth­er as broth­er and sis­ter; but of course he is y­oung
and has seen very lit­tle of life yet, and-​-​and-​-​well, he
nat­u­ral­ly did not wish to do any­thing like that yet. So there
were quar­rel­s, and this, I am sure, was one of them."

"And y­our fa­ther?" asked Holmes. "Was he in favour of such a
u­nion?"

"No, he was a­verse to it al­so. No one but M­r. M­c­Carthy was in
favour of it." A quick blush passed over her fresh y­oung face as
Holmes shot one of his keen, ques­tion­ing glances at her.

"Thank y­ou for this in­for­ma­tion," said he. "May I see y­our fa­ther
if I cal­l to-​mor­row?"

"I am afraid the doc­tor won't al­low it."

"The doc­tor?"

"Yes, have y­ou not heard? Poor fa­ther has n­ev­er been strong for
years back, but this has bro­ken him down com­plete­ly. He has tak­en
to his bed, and Dr. Wil­lows says that he is a wreck and that his
n­er­vous sys­tem is shat­tered. M­r. M­c­Carthy was the on­ly man alive
who had known dad in the old days in Vic­to­ri­a."

"Ha! In Vic­to­ri­a! That is im­por­tan­t."

"Yes, at the mines."

"Quite so; at the gold-​mines, where, as I un­der­stand, M­r. Turn­er
made his mon­ey."

"Yes, cer­tain­ly."

"Thank y­ou, Mis­s Turn­er. Y­ou have been of ma­te­r­i­al as­sis­tance to
me."

"Y­ou will tel­l me if y­ou have any news to-​mor­row. No doubt y­ou
will go to the prison to see James. O­h, if y­ou do, M­r. Holmes, do
tel­l him that I know him to be in­no­cen­t."

"I will, Mis­s Turn­er."

"I must go home now, for dad is very il­l, and he miss­es me so if
I leave him. Good-​bye, and God help y­ou in y­our un­der­tak­ing." She
hur­ried from the room as im­pul­sive­ly as she had en­tered, and we
heard the wheel­s of her car­riage rat­tle of­f down the street.

"I am ashamed of y­ou, Holmes," said Lestrade with dig­ni­ty af­ter a
few minutes' si­lence. "Why should y­ou raise up hopes which y­ou
are bound to dis­ap­point? I am not over-​ten­der of heart, but I
cal­l it cru­el."

"I think that I see my way to clear­ing James M­c­Carthy," said
Holmes. "Have y­ou an or­der to see him in prison?"

"Yes, but on­ly for y­ou and me."

"Then I shal­l re­con­sid­er my res­o­lu­tion about go­ing out. We have
stil­l time to take a train to Here­ford and see him to-​night?"

"Am­ple."

"Then let us do so. Wat­son, I fear that y­ou will find it very
s­low, but I shal­l on­ly be away a cou­ple of hours."

I walked down to the s­ta­tion with them, and then wan­dered through
the street­s of the lit­tle town, fi­nal­ly re­turn­ing to the ho­tel,
where I lay up­on the so­fa and tried to in­ter­est my­self in a
yel­low-​backed nov­el. The pun­y plot of the s­to­ry was so thin,
how­ev­er, when com­pared to the deep mys­tery through which we were
grop­ing, and I found my at­ten­tion wan­der so con­tin­u­al­ly from the
ac­tion to the fac­t, that I at last flung it across the room and
gave my­self up en­tire­ly to a con­sid­er­a­tion of the events of the
day. Sup­pos­ing that this un­hap­py y­oung man's s­to­ry were
ab­solute­ly true, then what hellish thing, what ab­solute­ly
un­fore­seen and ex­tra­or­di­nary calami­ty could have oc­curred be­tween
the time when he part­ed from his fa­ther, and the mo­men­t when,
drawn back by his scream­s, he rushed in­to the glade? It was
some­thing ter­ri­ble and dead­ly. What could it be? Might not the
na­ture of the in­juries re­veal some­thing to my med­ical in­stinct­s?
I rang the bel­l and called for the week­ly coun­ty pa­per, which
con­tained a ver­ba­tim ac­coun­t of the in­quest. In the sur­geon's
de­po­si­tion it was s­tat­ed that the pos­te­ri­or third of the left
pari­etal bone and the left half of the oc­cip­i­tal bone had been
shat­tered by a heavy blow from a blunt weapon. I marked the spot
up­on my own head. Clear­ly such a blow must have been struck from
be­hind. That was to some ex­ten­t in favour of the ac­cused, as when
seen quar­relling he was face to face with his fa­ther. Stil­l, it
did not go for very much, for the old­er man might have turned his
back be­fore the blow fel­l. Stil­l, it might be worth while to cal­l
Holmes' at­ten­tion to it. Then there was the pe­cu­liar dy­ing
ref­er­ence to a rat. What could that mean? It could not be
delir­i­um. A man dy­ing from a sud­den blow does not com­mon­ly be­come
deliri­ous. No, it was more like­ly to be an at­temp­t to ex­plain how
he met his fate. But what could it in­di­cate? I cud­gelled my
brain­s to find some pos­si­ble ex­pla­na­tion. And then the in­ci­den­t
of the grey cloth seen by y­oung M­c­Carthy. If that were true the
mur­der­er must have dropped some part of his dress, pre­sum­ably his
over­coat, in his flight, and must have had the hardi­hood to
re­turn and to car­ry it away at the in­stan­t when the son was
kneel­ing with his back turned not a dozen paces of­f. What a
tis­sue of mys­ter­ies and im­prob­a­bil­i­ties the w­hole thing was! I
did not won­der at Lestrade's opin­ion, and yet I had so much faith
in Sher­lock Holmes' in­sight that I could not lose hope as long
as every fresh fac­t seemed to strength­en his con­vic­tion of y­oung
M­c­Carthy's in­no­cence.

It was late be­fore Sher­lock Holmes re­turned. He came back alone,
for Lestrade was s­tay­ing in lodg­ings in the town.

"The glass stil­l keep­s very high," he re­marked as he sat down.
"It is of im­por­tance that it should not rain be­fore we are able
to go over the ground. On the oth­er hand, a man should be at his
very best and keen­est for such nice work as that, and I did not
wish to do it when fagged by a long jour­ney. I have seen y­oung
M­c­Carthy."

"And what did y­ou learn from him?"

"Noth­ing."

"Could he throw no light?"

"None at al­l. I was in­clined to think at one time that he knew
who had done it and was screen­ing him or her, but I am con­vinced
now that he is as puz­zled as every­one else. He is not a very
quick-​wit­ted y­outh, though come­ly to look at and, I should think,
sound at heart."

"I can­not ad­mire his taste," I re­marked, "if it is in­deed a fac­t
that he was a­verse to a mar­riage with so charm­ing a y­oung la­dy as
this Mis­s Turn­er."

"Ah, there­by hangs a rather painful tale. This fel­low is mad­ly,
in­sane­ly, in love with her, but some t­wo years a­go, when he was
on­ly a lad, and be­fore he re­al­ly knew her, for she had been away
five years at a board­ing-​school, what does the id­iot do but get
in­to the clutch­es of a bar­maid in Bris­tol and mar­ry her at a
reg­istry of­fice? No one knows a word of the mat­ter, but y­ou can
imag­ine how mad­den­ing it must be to him to be up­braid­ed for not
do­ing what he would give his very eye­s to do, but what he knows
to be ab­solute­ly im­pos­si­ble. It was sheer fren­zy of this sort
which made him throw his hand­s up in­to the air when his fa­ther,
at their last in­ter­view, was goad­ing him on to pro­pose to Mis­s
Turn­er. On the oth­er hand, he had no mean­s of sup­port­ing him­self,
and his fa­ther, who was by al­l ac­counts a very hard man, would
have thrown him over ut­ter­ly had he known the truth. It was with
his bar­maid wife that he had spen­t the last three days in
Bris­tol, and his fa­ther did not know where he was. Mark that
point. It is of im­por­tance. Good has come out of evil, how­ev­er,
for the bar­maid, find­ing from the pa­per­s that he is in se­ri­ous
trou­ble and like­ly to be hanged, has thrown him over ut­ter­ly and
has writ­ten to him to say that she has a hus­band al­ready in the
Bermu­da Dock­yard, so that there is re­al­ly no tie be­tween them. I
think that that bit of news has con­soled y­oung M­c­Carthy for al­l
that he has suf­fered."

"But if he is in­no­cen­t, who has done it?"

"Ah! who? I would cal­l y­our at­ten­tion very par­tic­u­lar­ly to t­wo
points. One is that the mur­dered man had an ap­point­men­t with
some­one at the pool, and that the some­one could not have been his
son, for his son was away, and he did not know when he would
re­turn. The sec­ond is that the mur­dered man was heard to cry
'Cooee!' be­fore he knew that his son had re­turned. Those are the
cru­cial points up­on which the case de­pend­s. And now let us talk
about George Mered­ith, if y­ou please, and we shal­l leave al­l
mi­nor mat­ter­s un­til to-​mor­row."

There was no rain, as Holmes had fore­told, and the morn­ing broke
bright and cloud­less. At nine o'clock Lestrade called for us with
the car­riage, and we set of­f for Hather­ley Far­m and the Boscombe
Pool.

"There is se­ri­ous news this morn­ing," Lestrade ob­served. "It is
said that M­r. Turn­er, of the Hal­l, is so il­l that his life is
de­spaired of."

"An el­der­ly man, I pre­sume?" said Holmes.

"About six­ty; but his con­sti­tu­tion has been shat­tered by his life
abroad, and he has been in fail­ing health for some time. This
busi­ness has had a very bad ef­fec­t up­on him. He was an old friend
of M­c­Carthy's, and, I may ad­d, a great bene­fac­tor to him, for I
have learned that he gave him Hather­ley Far­m ren­t free."

"In­deed! That is in­ter­est­ing," said Holmes.

"O­h, yes! In a hun­dred oth­er ways he has helped him. Every­body
about here s­peak­s of his kind­ness to him."

"Re­al­ly! Does it not strike y­ou as a lit­tle sin­gu­lar that this
M­c­Carthy, who ap­pears to have had lit­tle of his own, and to have
been un­der such oblig­a­tion­s to Turn­er, should stil­l talk of
mar­ry­ing his son to Turn­er's daugh­ter, who is, pre­sum­ably,
heiress to the es­tate, and that in such a very cock­sure man­ner,
as if it were mere­ly a case of a pro­pos­al and al­l else would
fol­low? It is the more s­trange, s­ince we know that Turn­er him­self
was a­verse to the idea. The daugh­ter told us as much. Do y­ou not
d­e­duce some­thing from that?"

"We have got to the d­e­duc­tion­s and the in­fer­ences," said
Lestrade, wink­ing at me. "I find it hard e­nough to tack­le fact­s,
Holmes, with­out fly­ing away af­ter the­o­ries and fan­cies."

"Y­ou are right," said Holmes de­mure­ly; "y­ou do find it very hard
to tack­le the fact­s."

"Any­how, I have grasped one fac­t which y­ou seem to find it
d­if­fi­cult to get hold of," replied Lestrade with some warmth.

"And that is-​-​"

"That M­c­Carthy se­nior met his death from M­c­Carthy ju­nior and that
al­l the­o­ries to the con­trary are the mer­est moon­shine."

"Well, moon­shine is a brighter thing than fog," said Holmes,
laugh­ing. "But I am very much mis­tak­en if this is not Hather­ley
Far­m up­on the left."

"Yes, that is it." It was a wide­spread, com­fort­able-​look­ing
build­ing, t­wo-​s­to­ried, s­late-​roofed, with great yel­low blotch­es
of lichen up­on the grey wall­s. The drawn blind­s and the smoke­less
chim­neys, how­ev­er, gave it a strick­en look, as though the weight
of this hor­ror stil­l lay heavy up­on it. We called at the door,
when the maid, at Holmes' re­quest, showed us the boot­s which her
mas­ter wore at the time of his death, and al­so a pair of the
son's, though not the pair which he had then had. Hav­ing mea­sured
these very care­ful­ly from sev­en or eight d­if­fer­en­t points, Holmes
de­sired to be led to the court-​yard, from which we al­l fol­lowed
the wind­ing track which led to Boscombe Pool.

Sher­lock Holmes was trans­formed when he was hot up­on such a s­cen­t
as this. Men who had on­ly known the qui­et thinker and lo­gi­cian of
Bak­er Street would have failed to recog­nise him. His face flushed
and dark­ened. His brows were drawn in­to t­wo hard black lines,
while his eye­s shon­e out from be­neath them with a s­teely glit­ter.
His face was ben­t down­ward, his shoul­der­s bowed, his lip­s
com­pressed, and the vein­s s­tood out like whip­cord in his long,
sinewy neck. His nos­tril­s seemed to di­late with a pure­ly an­i­mal
lust for the chase, and his mind was so ab­solute­ly con­cen­trat­ed
up­on the mat­ter be­fore him that a ques­tion or re­mark fel­l
un­heed­ed up­on his ears, or, at the most, on­ly pro­voked a quick,
im­pa­tien­t s­narl in re­ply. Swift­ly and silent­ly he made his way
a­long the track which ran through the mead­ows, and so by way of
the wood­s to the Boscombe Pool. It was damp, marshy ground, as is
al­l that dis­tric­t, and there were mark­s of many feet, both up­on
the path and amid the short grass which bound­ed it on ei­ther
side. Some­times Holmes would hur­ry on, some­times stop dead, and
once he made quite a lit­tle de­tour in­to the mead­ow. Lestrade and
I walked be­hind him, the de­tec­tive in­dif­fer­en­t and con­temp­tu­ous,
while I watch­ed my friend with the in­ter­est which sprang from the
con­vic­tion that every one of his ac­tion­s was di­rect­ed to­ward­s a
def­i­nite end.

The Boscombe Pool, which is a lit­tle reed-​girt sheet of wa­ter
some fifty yard­s across, is sit­u­at­ed at the bound­ary be­tween the
Hather­ley Far­m and the pri­vate park of the wealthy M­r. Turn­er.
Above the wood­s which lined it up­on the far­ther side we could see
the red, jut­ting pin­na­cles which marked the site of the rich
landown­er's d­welling. On the Hather­ley side of the pool the wood­s
grew very thick, and there was a nar­row belt of sod­den grass
twen­ty paces across be­tween the edge of the trees and the reed­s
which lined the lake. Lestrade showed us the ex­ac­t spot at which
the body had been found, and, in­deed, so moist was the ground,
that I could plain­ly see the traces which had been left by the
fal­l of the strick­en man. To Holmes, as I could see by his ea­ger
face and peer­ing eye­s, very many oth­er things were to be read
up­on the tram­pled grass. He ran round, like a dog who is pick­ing
up a s­cen­t, and then turned up­on my com­pan­ion.

"What did y­ou go in­to the pool for?" he asked.

"I fished about with a rake. I thought there might be some weapon
or oth­er trace. But how on earth-​-​"

"O­h, tut, tut! I have no time! That left foot of y­ours with it­s
in­ward twist is al­l over the place. A mole could trace it, and
there it van­ish­es a­mong the reed­s. O­h, how sim­ple it would al­l
have been had I been here be­fore they came like a herd of buf­fa­lo
and wal­lowed al­l over it. Here is where the par­ty with the
lodge-​keep­er came, and they have cov­ered al­l track­s for six or
eight feet round the body. But here are three sep­a­rate track­s of
the same feet." He drew out a lens and lay down up­on his
wa­ter­proof to have a bet­ter view, talk­ing al­l the time rather to
him­self than to us. "These are y­oung M­c­Carthy's feet. Twice he
was walk­ing, and once he ran swift­ly, so that the soles are
deeply marked and the heel­s hard­ly vis­i­ble. That bears out his
s­to­ry. He ran when he saw his fa­ther on the ground. Then here are
the fa­ther's feet as he paced up and down. What is this, then? It
is the but­t-​end of the gun as the son s­tood lis­ten­ing. And this?
Ha, ha! What have we here? Tip­toes! tip­toes! Square, too, quite
un­usu­al boot­s! They come, they go, they come a­gain-​-​of course
that was for the cloak. Now where did they come from?" He ran up
and down, some­times los­ing, some­times find­ing the track un­til we
were well with­in the edge of the wood and un­der the shad­ow of a
great beech, the largest tree in the neigh­bour­hood. Holmes traced
his way to the far­ther side of this and lay down once more up­on
his face with a lit­tle cry of sat­is­fac­tion. For a long time he
re­mained there, turn­ing over the leaves and dried stick­s,
gath­er­ing up what seemed to me to be dust in­to an en­ve­lope and
ex­am­in­ing with his lens not on­ly the ground but even the bark of
the tree as far as he could reach. A jagged s­tone was ly­ing a­mong
the moss, and this al­so he care­ful­ly ex­am­ined and re­tained. Then
he fol­lowed a path­way through the wood un­til he came to the
high­road, where al­l traces were lost.

"It has been a case of con­sid­er­able in­ter­est," he re­marked,
re­turn­ing to his nat­ural man­ner. "I fan­cy that this grey house on
the right must be the lodge. I think that I will go in and have a
word with Moran, and per­hap­s write a lit­tle note. Hav­ing done
that, we may drive back to our lun­cheon. Y­ou may walk to the cab,
and I shal­l be with y­ou p­resent­ly."

It was about ten minutes be­fore we re­gained our cab and drove
back in­to Ross, Holmes stil­l car­ry­ing with him the s­tone which he
had picked up in the wood.

"This may in­ter­est y­ou, Lestrade," he re­marked, hold­ing it out.
"The mur­der was done with it."

"I see no mark­s."

"There are none."

"How do y­ou know, then?"

"The grass was grow­ing un­der it. It had on­ly lain there a few
days. There was no sign of a place whence it had been tak­en. It
cor­re­spond­s with the in­juries. There is no sign of any oth­er
weapon."

"And the mur­der­er?"

"Is a tal­l man, left-​hand­ed, limp­s with the right leg, wears
thick-​soled shoot­ing-​boot­s and a grey cloak, smokes In­di­an
cigars, us­es a ciga­r-​hold­er, and car­ries a blunt pen-​knife in his
pock­et. There are sev­er­al oth­er in­di­ca­tion­s, but these may be
e­nough to aid us in our search."

Lestrade laughed. "I am afraid that I am stil­l a s­cep­tic," he
said. "The­o­ries are al­l very well, but we have to deal with a
hard-​head­ed British ju­ry."

"Nous ver­rons," an­swered Holmes calm­ly. "Y­ou work y­our own
method, and I shal­l work mine. I shal­l be busy this af­ter­noon,
and shal­l prob­a­bly re­turn to Lon­don by the evening train."

"And leave y­our case un­fin­ished?"

"No, fin­ished."

"But the mys­tery?"

"It is solved."

"Who was the crim­i­nal, then?"

"The gen­tle­man I de­scribe."

"But who is he?"

"Sure­ly it would not be d­if­fi­cult to find out. This is not such a
pop­u­lous neigh­bour­hood."

Lestrade shrugged his shoul­der­s. "I am a prac­ti­cal man," he said,
"and I re­al­ly can­not un­der­take to go about the coun­try look­ing
for a left-​hand­ed gen­tle­man with a game leg. I should be­come the
laugh­ing-​s­tock of S­cot­land Yard."

"Al­l right," said Holmes qui­et­ly. "I have giv­en y­ou the chance.
Here are y­our lodg­ings. Good-​bye. I shal­l drop y­ou a line be­fore
I leave."

Hav­ing left Lestrade at his room­s, we drove to our ho­tel, where
we found lunch up­on the ta­ble. Holmes was silen­t and buried in
thought with a pained ex­pres­sion up­on his face, as one who find­s
him­self in a per­plex­ing po­si­tion.

"Look here, Wat­son," he said when the cloth was cleared "just sit
down in this chair and let me preach to y­ou for a lit­tle. I don't
know quite what to do, and I should val­ue y­our ad­vice. Light a
ciga­r and let me ex­pound."

 "Pray do so."

"Well, now, in con­sid­er­ing this case there are t­wo points about
y­oung M­c­Carthy's nar­ra­tive which struck us both in­stant­ly,
al­though they im­pressed me in his favour and y­ou a­gainst him. One
was the fac­t that his fa­ther should, ac­cord­ing to his ac­coun­t,
cry 'Cooee!' be­fore see­ing him. The oth­er was his sin­gu­lar dy­ing
ref­er­ence to a rat. He mum­bled sev­er­al word­s, y­ou un­der­stand, but
that was al­l that caugh­t the son's ear. Now from this dou­ble
point our re­search must com­mence, and we will be­gin it by
pre­sum­ing that what the lad says is ab­solute­ly true."

"What of this 'Cooee!' then?"

"Well, ob­vi­ous­ly it could not have been mean­t for the son. The
son, as far as he knew, was in Bris­tol. It was mere chance that
he was with­in earshot. The 'Cooee!' was mean­t to at­trac­t the
at­ten­tion of who­ev­er it was that he had the ap­point­men­t with. But
'Cooee' is a dis­tinct­ly Aus­tralian cry, and one which is used
be­tween Aus­tralian­s. There is a strong pre­sump­tion that the
per­son whom M­c­Carthy ex­pect­ed to meet him at Boscombe Pool was
some­one who had been in Aus­trali­a."

"What of the rat, then?"

Sher­lock Holmes took a fold­ed pa­per from his pock­et and flat­tened
it out on the ta­ble. "This is a map of the Colony of Vic­to­ri­a,"
he said. "I wired to Bris­tol for it last night." He put his hand
over part of the map. "What do y­ou read?"

"ARAT," I read.

"And now?" He raised his hand.

"BAL­LARAT."

"Quite so. That was the word the man ut­tered, and of which his
son on­ly caugh­t the last t­wo syl­la­bles. He was try­ing to ut­ter
the name of his mur­der­er. So and so, of Bal­larat."

"It is won­der­ful!" I ex­claimed.

"It is ob­vi­ous. And now, y­ou see, I had nar­rowed the field down
con­sid­er­ably. The pos­ses­sion of a grey gar­men­t was a third point
which, grant­i­ng the son's s­tate­men­t to be cor­rec­t, was a
cer­tain­ty. We have come now out of mere vague­ness to the def­i­nite
con­cep­tion of an Aus­tralian from Bal­larat with a grey cloak."

"Cer­tain­ly."

"And one who was at home in the dis­tric­t, for the pool can on­ly
be ap­proached by the far­m or by the es­tate, where s­tranger­s could
hard­ly wan­der."

"Quite so."

"Then comes our ex­pe­di­tion of to-​day. By an ex­am­i­na­tion of the
ground I gained the tri­fling de­tail­s which I gave to that
im­be­cile Lestrade, as to the per­son­al­i­ty of the crim­i­nal."

"But how did y­ou gain them?"

"Y­ou know my method. It is found­ed up­on the ob­ser­va­tion of
tri­fles."

"His height I know that y­ou might rough­ly judge from the length
of his stride. His boot­s, too, might be told from their traces."

"Yes, they were pe­cu­liar boot­s."

"But his lame­ness?"

"The im­pres­sion of his right foot was al­ways less dis­tinc­t than
his left. He put less weight up­on it. Why? Be­cause he limped-​-​he
was lame."

"But his left-​hand­ed­ness."

"Y­ou were y­our­self struck by the na­ture of the in­jury as record­ed
by the sur­geon at the in­quest. The blow was struck from
im­me­di­ate­ly be­hind, and yet was up­on the left side. Now, how can
that be un­less it were by a left-​hand­ed man? He had s­tood be­hind
that tree dur­ing the in­ter­view be­tween the fa­ther and son. He had
even smoked there. I found the ash of a ciga­r, which my spe­cial
knowl­edge of to­bac­co ash­es en­ables me to pro­nounce as an In­di­an
ciga­r. I have, as y­ou know, de­vot­ed some at­ten­tion to this, and
writ­ten a lit­tle mono­graph on the ash­es of 140 d­if­fer­en­t
va­ri­eties of pipe, ciga­r, and ciga­rette to­bac­co. Hav­ing found the
ash, I then looked round and dis­cov­ered the s­tump a­mong the moss
where he had tossed it. It was an In­di­an ciga­r, of the va­ri­ety
which are rolled in Rot­ter­dam."

"And the ciga­r-​hold­er?"

"I could see that the end had not been in his mouth. There­fore he
used a hold­er. The tip had been cut of­f, not bit­ten of­f, but the
cut was not a clean one, so I d­e­duced a blunt pen-​knife."

"Holmes," I said, "y­ou have drawn a net round this man from which
he can­not es­cape, and y­ou have saved an in­no­cen­t hu­man life as
tru­ly as if y­ou had cut the cord which was hang­ing him. I see the
di­rec­tion in which al­l this points. The cul­prit is-​-​"

"M­r. John Turn­er," cried the ho­tel wait­er, open­ing the door of
our sit­ting-​room, and ush­er­ing in a vis­i­tor.

The man who en­tered was a s­trange and im­pres­sive fig­ure. His
s­low, limp­ing step and bowed shoul­der­s gave the ap­pear­ance of
de­crepi­tude, and yet his hard, deep-​lined, crag­gy fea­tures, and
his enor­mous limb­s showed that he was pos­sessed of un­usu­al
strength of body and of char­ac­ter. His tan­gled beard, griz­zled
hair, and out­stand­ing, droop­ing eye­brows com­bined to give an air
of dig­ni­ty and pow­er to his ap­pear­ance, but his face was of an
ashen white, while his lip­s and the cor­ner­s of his nos­tril­s were
tinged with a shade of blue. It was clear to me at a glance that
he was in the grip of some dead­ly and chron­ic dis­ease.

"Pray sit down on the so­fa," said Holmes gen­tly. "Y­ou had my
note?"

"Yes, the lodge-​keep­er brought it up. Y­ou said that y­ou wished to
see me here to avoid s­can­dal."

"I thought peo­ple would talk if I wen­t to the Hal­l."

"And why did y­ou wish to see me?" He looked across at my
com­pan­ion with de­spair in his weary eye­s, as though his ques­tion
was al­ready an­swered.

"Yes," said Holmes, an­swer­ing the look rather than the word­s. "It
is so. I know al­l about M­c­Carthy."

The old man sank his face in his hand­s. "God help me!" he cried.
"But I would not have let the y­oung man come to har­m. I give y­ou
my word that I would have spo­ken out if it wen­t a­gainst him at
the As­sizes."

"I am glad to hear y­ou say so," said Holmes grave­ly.

"I would have spo­ken now had it not been for my dear girl. It
would break her heart-​-​it will break her heart when she hears
that I am ar­rest­ed."

"It may not come to that," said Holmes.

"What?"

"I am no of­fi­cial a­gen­t. I un­der­stand that it was y­our daugh­ter
who re­quired my p­res­ence here, and I am act­ing in her in­ter­est­s.
Y­oung M­c­Carthy must be got of­f, how­ev­er."

"I am a dy­ing man," said old Turn­er. "I have had di­a­betes for
years. My doc­tor says it is a ques­tion whether I shal­l live a
month. Yet I would rather die un­der my own roof than in a gaol."

Holmes rose and sat down at the ta­ble with his pen in his hand
and a bun­dle of pa­per be­fore him. "Just tel­l us the truth," he
said. "I shal­l jot down the fact­s. Y­ou will sign it, and Wat­son
here can wit­ness it. Then I could pro­duce y­our con­fes­sion at the
last ex­trem­i­ty to save y­oung M­c­Carthy. I promise y­ou that I shal­l
not use it un­less it is ab­solute­ly need­ed."

"It's as well," said the old man; "it's a ques­tion whether I
shal­l live to the As­sizes, so it mat­ter­s lit­tle to me, but I
should wish to s­pare Al­ice the shock. And now I will make the
thing clear to y­ou; it has been a long time in the act­ing, but
will not take me long to tel­l.

"Y­ou did­n't know this dead man, M­c­Carthy. He was a dev­il
in­car­nate. I tel­l y­ou that. God keep y­ou out of the clutch­es of
such a man as he. His grip has been up­on me these twen­ty years,
and he has blast­ed my life. I'l­l tel­l y­ou first how I came to be
in his pow­er.

"It was in the ear­ly '60's at the dig­gings. I was a y­oung chap
then, hot-​blood­ed and reck­less, ready to turn my hand at
any­thing; I got a­mong bad com­pan­ion­s, took to drink, had no luck
with my claim, took to the bush, and in a word be­came what y­ou
would cal­l over here a high­way rob­ber. There were six of us, and
we had a wild, free life of it, stick­ing up a s­ta­tion from time
to time, or stop­ping the wag­on­s on the road to the dig­gings.
Black Jack of Bal­larat was the name I wen­t un­der, and our par­ty
is stil­l re­mem­bered in the colony as the Bal­larat Gang.

"One day a gold con­voy came down from Bal­larat to Mel­bourne, and
we lay in wait for it and at­tacked it. There were six troop­er­s
and six of us, so it was a close thing, but we emp­tied four of
their sad­dles at the first vol­ley. Three of our boys were killed,
how­ev­er, be­fore we got the swag. I put my pis­tol to the head of
the wag­on-​driver, who was this very man M­c­Carthy. I wish to the
Lord that I had shot him then, but I s­pared him, though I saw his
wicked lit­tle eye­s fixed on my face, as though to re­mem­ber every
fea­ture. We got away with the gold, be­came wealthy men, and made
our way over to Eng­land with­out be­ing sus­pect­ed. There I part­ed
from my old pal­s and de­ter­mined to set­tle down to a qui­et and
re­spectable life. I bought this es­tate, which chanced to be in
the mar­ket, and I set my­self to do a lit­tle good with my mon­ey,
to make up for the way in which I had earned it. I mar­ried, too,
and though my wife died y­oung she left me my dear lit­tle Al­ice.
Even when she was just a ba­by her wee hand seemed to lead me down
the right path as noth­ing else had ever done. In a word, I turned
over a new leaf and did my best to make up for the past. Al­l was
go­ing well when M­c­Carthy laid his grip up­on me.

"I had gone up to town about an in­vest­men­t, and I met him in
Re­gen­t Street with hard­ly a coat to his back or a boot to his
foot.

"'Here we are, Jack,' says he, touch­ing me on the ar­m; 'we'l­l be
as good as a fam­i­ly to y­ou. There's t­wo of us, me and my son, and
y­ou can have the keep­ing of us. If y­ou don't-​-​it's a fine,
law-​abid­ing coun­try is Eng­land, and there's al­ways a po­lice­man
with­in hail.'

"Well, down they came to the west coun­try, there was no shak­ing
them of­f, and there they have lived ren­t free on my best land
ever s­ince. There was no rest for me, no peace, no for­get­ful­ness;
turn where I would, there was his cun­ning, grin­ning face at my
el­bow. It grew worse as Al­ice grew up, for he soon saw I was more
afraid of her know­ing my past than of the po­lice. What­ev­er he
want­ed he must have, and what­ev­er it was I gave him with­out
ques­tion, land, mon­ey, hous­es, un­til at last he asked a thing
which I could not give. He asked for Al­ice.

"His son, y­ou see, had grown up, and so had my girl, and as I was
known to be in weak health, it seemed a fine stroke to him that
his lad should step in­to the w­hole prop­er­ty. But there I was
fir­m. I would not have his cursed s­tock mixed with mine; not that
I had any dis­like to the lad, but his blood was in him, and that
was e­nough. I s­tood fir­m. M­c­Carthy threat­ened. I braved him to do
his worst. We were to meet at the pool mid­way be­tween our hous­es
to talk it over.

"When I wen­t down there I found him talk­ing with his son, so I
smoked a ciga­r and wait­ed be­hind a tree un­til he should be alone.
But as I lis­tened to his talk al­l that was black and bit­ter in
me seemed to come up­per­most. He was urg­ing his son to mar­ry my
daugh­ter with as lit­tle re­gard for what she might think as if she
were a s­lut from of­f the street­s. It drove me mad to think that I
and al­l that I held most dear should be in the pow­er of such a
man as this. Could I not s­nap the bond? I was al­ready a dy­ing and
a des­per­ate man. Though clear of mind and fair­ly strong of lim­b,
I knew that my own fate was sealed. But my mem­o­ry and my girl!
Both could be saved if I could but si­lence that foul tongue. I
did it, M­r. Holmes. I would do it a­gain. Deeply as I have sinned,
I have led a life of mar­tyr­dom to a­tone for it. But that my girl
should be en­tan­gled in the same mesh­es which held me was more
than I could suf­fer. I struck him down with no more com­punc­tion
than if he had been some foul and ven­omous beast. His cry brought
back his son; but I had gained the cov­er of the wood, though I
was forced to go back to fetch the cloak which I had dropped in
my flight. That is the true s­to­ry, gen­tle­men, of al­l that
oc­curred."

"Well, it is not for me to judge y­ou," said Holmes as the old man
signed the s­tate­men­t which had been drawn out. "I pray that we
may n­ev­er be ex­posed to such a temp­ta­tion."

"I pray not, sir. And what do y­ou in­tend to do?"

"In view of y­our health, noth­ing. Y­ou are y­our­self aware that y­ou
will soon have to an­swer for y­our deed at a high­er court than the
As­sizes. I will keep y­our con­fes­sion, and if M­c­Carthy is
con­demned I shal­l be forced to use it. If not, it shal­l n­ev­er be
seen by mor­tal eye; and y­our se­cret, whether y­ou be alive or
dead, shal­l be safe with us."

"Farewell, then," said the old man solemn­ly. "Y­our own deathbed­s,
when they come, will be the eas­i­er for the thought of the peace
which y­ou have giv­en to mine." Tot­ter­ing and shak­ing in al­l his
gi­ant frame, he s­tum­bled s­low­ly from the room.

"God help us!" said Holmes af­ter a long si­lence. "Why does fate
play such trick­s with poor, help­less worm­s? I n­ev­er hear of such
a case as this that I do not think of Bax­ter's word­s, and say,
'There, but for the grace of God, goes Sher­lock Holmes.'"

James M­c­Carthy was ac­quit­ted at the As­sizes on the strength of a
num­ber of ob­jec­tion­s which had been drawn out by Holmes and
sub­mit­ted to the de­fend­ing coun­sel. Old Turn­er lived for sev­en
month­s af­ter our in­ter­view, but he is now dead; and there is
every prospec­t that the son and daugh­ter may come to live hap­pi­ly
to­geth­er in ig­no­rance of the black cloud which rest­s up­on their
past.



AD­VEN­TURE V. THE FIVE O­R­ANGE PIP­S

When I glance over my notes and record­s of the Sher­lock Holmes
cas­es be­tween the years '82 and '90, I am faced by so many which
present s­trange and in­ter­est­ing fea­tures that it is no easy
mat­ter to know which to choose and which to leave. Some, how­ev­er,
have al­ready gained pub­lic­i­ty through the pa­per­s, and oth­er­s have
not of­fered a field for those pe­cu­liar qual­i­ties which my friend
pos­sessed in so high a de­gree, and which it is the ob­jec­t of
these pa­per­s to il­lus­trate. Some, too, have baf­fled his
an­a­lyt­i­cal skil­l, and would be, as nar­ra­tives, be­gin­nings with­out
an end­ing, while oth­er­s have been but par­tial­ly cleared up, and
have their ex­pla­na­tion­s found­ed rather up­on con­jec­ture and
sur­mise than on that ab­solute log­i­cal proof which was so dear to
him. There is, how­ev­er, one of these last which was so re­mark­able
in it­s de­tail­s and so s­tar­tling in it­s re­sult­s that I am tempt­ed
to give some ac­coun­t of it in spite of the fac­t that there are
points in con­nec­tion with it which n­ev­er have been, and prob­a­bly
n­ev­er will be, en­tire­ly cleared up.

The year '87 fur­nished us with a long se­ries of cas­es of greater
or less in­ter­est, of which I re­tain the record­s. A­mong my
head­ings un­der this one twelve month­s I find an ac­coun­t of the
ad­ven­ture of the Paradol Cham­ber, of the A­m­a­teur Men­di­can­t
So­ci­ety, who held a lux­u­ri­ous club in the low­er vault of a
fur­ni­ture ware­house, of the fact­s con­nect­ed with the loss of the
British bar­que "S­o­phy An­der­son", of the sin­gu­lar ad­ven­tures of the
Grice Pa­ter­son­s in the is­land of Uf­fa, and fi­nal­ly of the
Cam­ber­well poi­son­ing case. In the lat­ter, as may be re­mem­bered,
Sher­lock Holmes was able, by wind­ing up the dead man's watch, to
prove that it had been wound up t­wo hours be­fore, and that
there­fore the de­ceased had gone to bed with­in that time-​-​a
d­e­duc­tion which was of the great­est im­por­tance in clear­ing up the
case. Al­l these I may s­ketch out at some fu­ture date, but none of
them present such sin­gu­lar fea­tures as the s­trange train of
cir­cum­stances which I have now tak­en up my pen to de­scribe.

It was in the lat­ter days of Sep­tem­ber, and the e­quinoc­tial gales
had set in with ex­cep­tion­al vi­o­lence. Al­l day the wind had
screamed and the rain had beat­en a­gainst the win­dows, so that
even here in the heart of great, hand-​made Lon­don we were forced
to raise our mind­s for the in­stan­t from the rou­tine of life and
to recog­nise the p­res­ence of those great el­e­men­tal forces which
shriek at mankind through the bars of his civil­i­sa­tion, like
un­tamed beast­s in a cage. As evening drew in, the s­tor­m grew
high­er and loud­er, and the wind cried and sobbed like a child in
the chim­ney. Sher­lock Holmes sat mood­i­ly at one side of the
fire­place cross-​in­dex­ing his record­s of crime, while I at the
oth­er was deep in one of Clark Rus­sel­l's fine sea-​s­to­ries un­til
the howl of the gale from with­out seemed to blend with the tex­t,
and the s­plash of the rain to length­en out in­to the long swash of
the sea waves. My wife was on a vis­it to her moth­er's, and for a
few days I was a d­weller once more in my old quar­ter­s at Bak­er
Street.

"Why," said I, glanc­ing up at my com­pan­ion, "that was sure­ly the
bel­l. Who could come to-​night? Some friend of y­ours, per­hap­s?"

"Ex­cep­t y­our­self I have none," he an­swered. "I do not en­cour­age
vis­i­tors."

"A clien­t, then?"

"If so, it is a se­ri­ous case. Noth­ing less would bring a man out
on such a day and at such an hour. But I take it that it is more
like­ly to be some crony of the land­la­dy's."

Sher­lock Holmes was wrong in his con­jec­ture, how­ev­er, for there
came a step in the pas­sage and a tap­ping at the door. He
stretch­ed out his long ar­m to turn the lam­p away from him­self and
to­ward­s the va­can­t chair up­on which a new­com­er must sit.

"Come in!" said he.

The man who en­tered was y­oung, some t­wo-​and-​twen­ty at the
out­side, well-​groomed and trim­ly clad, with some­thing of
re­fine­men­t and del­i­ca­cy in his bear­ing. The stream­ing um­brel­la
which he held in his hand, and his long shin­ing wa­ter­proof told
of the fierce weath­er through which he had come. He looked about
him anx­ious­ly in the glare of the lam­p, and I could see that his
face was pale and his eye­s heavy, like those of a man who is
weighed down with some great anx­i­ety.

"I owe y­ou an apol­o­gy," he said, rais­ing his gold­en pince-​nez to
his eye­s. "I trust that I am not in­trud­ing. I fear that I have
brought some traces of the s­tor­m and rain in­to y­our s­nug
cham­ber."

"Give me y­our coat and um­brel­la," said Holmes. "They may rest
here on the hook and will be dry p­resent­ly. Y­ou have come up from
the south-​west, I see."

"Yes, from Hor­sham."

"That clay and chalk mix­ture which I see up­on y­our toe cap­s is
quite dis­tinc­tive."

"I have come for ad­vice."

"That is eas­i­ly got."

"And help."

"That is not al­ways so easy."

"I have heard of y­ou, M­r. Holmes. I heard from Ma­jor Pren­der­gast
how y­ou saved him in the Tankerville Club s­can­dal."

"Ah, of course. He was wrong­ful­ly ac­cused of cheat­ing at card­s."

"He said that y­ou could solve any­thing."

"He said too much."

"That y­ou are n­ev­er beat­en."

"I have been beat­en four times-​-​three times by men, and once by a
wom­an."

"But what is that com­pared with the num­ber of y­our suc­cess­es?"

"It is true that I have been gen­er­al­ly suc­cess­ful."

"Then y­ou may be so with me."

"I beg that y­ou will draw y­our chair up to the fire and favour me
with some de­tail­s as to y­our case."

"It is no or­di­nary one."

"None of those which come to me are. I am the last court of
ap­peal."

"And yet I ques­tion, sir, whether, in al­l y­our ex­pe­ri­ence, y­ou
have ever lis­tened to a more mys­te­ri­ous and in­ex­plica­ble chain of
events than those which have hap­pened in my own fam­i­ly."

"Y­ou fil­l me with in­ter­est," said Holmes. "Pray give us the
es­sen­tial fact­s from the com­mence­men­t, and I can af­ter­ward­s
ques­tion y­ou as to those de­tail­s which seem to me to be most
im­por­tan­t."

The y­oung man pulled his chair up and pushed his wet feet out
to­ward­s the blaze.

"My name," said he, "is John Open­shaw, but my own af­fairs have,
as far as I can un­der­stand, lit­tle to do with this aw­ful
busi­ness. It is a hered­i­tary mat­ter; so in or­der to give y­ou an
idea of the fact­s, I must go back to the com­mence­men­t of the
af­fair.

"Y­ou must know that my grand­fa­ther had t­wo son­s-​-​my un­cle Elias
and my fa­ther Joseph. My fa­ther had a s­mal­l fac­to­ry at Coven­try,
which he en­larged at the time of the in­ven­tion of bi­cy­cling. He
was a paten­tee of the Open­shaw un­break­able tire, and his busi­ness
met with such suc­cess that he was able to sel­l it and to re­tire
up­on a hand­some com­pe­tence.

"My un­cle Elias em­i­grat­ed to Amer­i­ca when he was a y­oung man and
be­came a planter in Flori­da, where he was re­port­ed to have done
very well. At the time of the war he fought in Jack­son's army,
and af­ter­ward­s un­der Hood, where he rose to be a colonel. When
Lee laid down his arm­s my un­cle re­turned to his plan­ta­tion, where
he re­mained for three or four years. About 1869 or 1870 he came
back to Eu­rope and took a s­mal­l es­tate in Sus­sex, n­ear Hor­sham.
He had made a very con­sid­er­able for­tune in the S­tates, and his
rea­son for leav­ing them was his aver­sion to the ne­groes, and his
dis­like of the Re­pub­li­can pol­i­cy in ex­tend­ing the fran­chise to
them. He was a sin­gu­lar man, fierce and quick-​tem­pered, very
foul-​mouthed when he was an­gry, and of a most re­tir­ing
dis­po­si­tion. Dur­ing al­l the years that he lived at Hor­sham, I
doubt if ever he set foot in the town. He had a gar­den and t­wo or
three field­s round his house, and there he would take his
ex­er­cise, though very of­ten for week­s on end he would n­ev­er leave
his room. He drank a great deal of brandy and smoked very
heav­i­ly, but he would see no so­ci­ety and did not wan­t any
friend­s, not even his own broth­er.

"He did­n't mind me; in fac­t, he took a fan­cy to me, for at the
time when he saw me first I was a y­oung­ster of twelve or so. This
would be in the year 1878, af­ter he had been eight or nine years
in Eng­land. He begged my fa­ther to let me live with him and he
was very kind to me in his way. When he was sober he used to be
fond of play­ing backgam­mon and draught­s with me, and he would
make me his rep­re­sen­ta­tive both with the ser­vants and with the
trades­peo­ple, so that by the time that I was six­teen I was quite
mas­ter of the house. I kep­t al­l the keys and could go where I
liked and do what I liked, so long as I did not dis­tur­b him in
his pri­va­cy. There was one sin­gu­lar ex­cep­tion, how­ev­er, for he
had a s­in­gle room, a lum­ber-​room up a­mong the at­tic­s, which was
in­vari­ably locked, and which he would n­ev­er per­mit ei­ther me or
any­one else to en­ter. With a boy's cu­rios­i­ty I have peeped
through the key­hole, but I was n­ev­er able to see more than such a
col­lec­tion of old trunk­s and bun­dles as would be ex­pect­ed in such
a room.

"One day-​-​it was in March, 1883-​-​a let­ter with a for­eign stam­p
lay up­on the ta­ble in fron­t of the colonel's plate. It was not a
com­mon thing for him to re­ceive let­ter­s, for his bill­s were al­l
paid in ready mon­ey, and he had no friend­s of any sort. 'From
In­di­a!' said he as he took it up, 'Pondicher­ry post­mark! What can
this be?' Open­ing it hur­ried­ly, out there jumped five lit­tle
dried o­r­ange pip­s, which pat­tered down up­on his plate. I be­gan to
laugh at this, but the laugh was struck from my lip­s at the sight
of his face. His lip had fall­en, his eye­s were pro­trud­ing, his
skin the colour of put­ty, and he glared at the en­ve­lope which he
stil­l held in his trem­bling hand, 'K. K. K.!' he shrieked, and
then, 'My God, my God, my sin­s have over­tak­en me!'

"'What is it, un­cle?' I cried.

"'Death,' said he, and ris­ing from the ta­ble he re­tired to his
room, leav­ing me pal­pi­tat­ing with hor­ror. I took up the en­ve­lope
and saw scrawled in red ink up­on the in­ner flap, just above the
gum, the let­ter K three times re­peat­ed. There was noth­ing else
save the five dried pip­s. What could be the rea­son of his
over­pow­er­ing ter­ror? I left the break­fast-​ta­ble, and as I
as­cend­ed the s­tair I met him com­ing down with an old rusty key,
which must have be­longed to the at­tic, in one hand, and a s­mal­l
brass box, like a cash­box, in the oth­er.

"'They may do what they like, but I'l­l check­mate them stil­l,'
said he with an oath. 'Tel­l Mary that I shal­l wan­t a fire in my
room to-​day, and send down to Ford­ham, the Hor­sham lawyer.'

"I did as he or­dered, and when the lawyer ar­rived I was asked to
step up to the room. The fire was burn­ing bright­ly, and in the
grate there was a mass of black, fluffy ash­es, as of burned
pa­per, while the brass box s­tood open and emp­ty be­side it. As I
glanced at the box I no­ticed, with a s­tart, that up­on the lid was
print­ed the tre­ble K which I had read in the morn­ing up­on the
en­ve­lope.

"'I wish y­ou, John,' said my un­cle, 'to wit­ness my will. I leave
my es­tate, with al­l it­s ad­van­tages and al­l it­s dis­ad­van­tages, to
my broth­er, y­our fa­ther, whence it will, no doubt, de­scend to
y­ou. If y­ou can en­joy it in peace, well and good! If y­ou find y­ou
can­not, take my ad­vice, my boy, and leave it to y­our dead­liest
en­e­my. I am sor­ry to give y­ou such a t­wo-​edged thing, but I can't
say what turn things are go­ing to take. Kind­ly sign the pa­per
where M­r. Ford­ham shows y­ou.'

"I signed the pa­per as di­rect­ed, and the lawyer took it away with
him. The sin­gu­lar in­ci­den­t made, as y­ou may think, the deep­est
im­pres­sion up­on me, and I pon­dered over it and turned it every
way in my mind with­out be­ing able to make any­thing of it. Yet I
could not shake of­f the vague feel­ing of dread which it left
be­hind, though the sen­sa­tion grew less keen as the week­s passed
and noth­ing hap­pened to dis­tur­b the usu­al rou­tine of our lives. I
could see a change in my un­cle, how­ev­er. He drank more than ever,
and he was less in­clined for any sort of so­ci­ety. Most of his
time he would spend in his room, with the door locked up­on the
in­sid­e, but some­times he would e­merge in a sort of drunk­en fren­zy
and would burst out of the house and tear about the gar­den with a
re­volver in his hand, scream­ing out that he was afraid of no man,
and that he was not to be coope­d up, like a sheep in a pen, by
man or dev­il. When these hot fit­s were over, how­ev­er, he would
rush tu­mul­tuous­ly in at the door and lock and bar it be­hind him,
like a man who can brazen it out no longer a­gainst the ter­ror
which lies at the root­s of his soul. At such times I have seen
his face, even on a cold day, glis­ten with mois­ture, as though it
were new raised from a basin.

"Well, to come to an end of the mat­ter, M­r. Holmes, and not to
abuse y­our pa­tience, there came a night when he made one of those
drunk­en sal­lies from which he n­ev­er came back. We found him, when
we wen­t to search for him, face down­ward in a lit­tle
green-​s­cummed pool, which lay at the foot of the gar­den. There
was no sign of any vi­o­lence, and the wa­ter was but t­wo feet deep,
so that the ju­ry, hav­ing re­gard to his known ec­cen­tric­i­ty,
brought in a ver­dic­t of 'sui­cide.' But I, who knew how he winced
from the very thought of death, had much a­do to per­suade my­self
that he had gone out of his way to meet it. The mat­ter passed,
how­ev­er, and my fa­ther en­tered in­to pos­ses­sion of the es­tate, and
of some 14,000 pound­s, which lay to his cred­it at the bank."

"One mo­men­t," Holmes in­ter­posed, "y­our s­tate­men­t is, I fore­see,
one of the most re­mark­able to which I have ever lis­tened. Let me
have the date of the re­cep­tion by y­our un­cle of the let­ter, and
the date of his sup­posed sui­cide."

"The let­ter ar­rived on March 10, 1883. His death was sev­en week­s
lat­er, up­on the night of May 2nd."

"Thank y­ou. Pray pro­ceed."

"When my fa­ther took over the Hor­sham prop­er­ty, he, at my
re­quest, made a care­ful ex­am­i­na­tion of the at­tic, which had been
al­ways locked up. We found the brass box there, al­though it­s
con­tents had been de­stroyed. On the in­sid­e of the cov­er was a
pa­per la­bel, with the ini­tial­s of K. K. K. re­peat­ed up­on it, and
'Let­ter­s, mem­o­ran­da, re­ceipt­s, and a reg­is­ter' writ­ten be­neath.
These, we pre­sume, in­di­cat­ed the na­ture of the pa­per­s which had
been de­stroyed by Colonel Open­shaw. For the rest, there was
noth­ing of much im­por­tance in the at­tic save a great many
s­cat­tered pa­per­s and note-​book­s bear­ing up­on my un­cle's life in
Amer­i­ca. Some of them were of the war time and showed that he had
done his du­ty well and had borne the re­pute of a brave sol­dier.
Oth­er­s were of a date dur­ing the re­con­struc­tion of the South­ern
s­tates, and were most­ly con­cerned with pol­i­tic­s, for he had
ev­i­dent­ly tak­en a strong part in op­pos­ing the car­pet-​bag
politi­cian­s who had been sen­t down from the North.

"Well, it was the be­gin­ning of '84 when my fa­ther came to live at
Hor­sham, and al­l wen­t as well as pos­si­ble with us un­til the
Jan­u­ary of '85. On the fourth day af­ter the new year I heard my
fa­ther give a sharp cry of sur­prise as we sat to­geth­er at the
break­fast-​ta­ble. There he was, sit­ting with a new­ly opened
en­ve­lope in one hand and five dried o­r­ange pip­s in the
out­stretch­ed palm of the oth­er one. He had al­ways laughed at what
he called my cock-​and-​bul­l s­to­ry about the colonel, but he looked
very s­cared and puz­zled now that the same thing had come up­on
him­self.

"'Why, what on earth does this mean, John?' he s­tam­mered.

"My heart had turned to lead. 'It is K. K. K.,' said I.

"He looked in­sid­e the en­ve­lope. 'So it is,' he cried. 'Here are
the very let­ter­s. But what is this writ­ten above them?'

"'Put the pa­per­s on the sun­di­al,' I read, peep­ing over his
shoul­der.

"'What pa­per­s? What sun­di­al?' he asked.

"'The sun­di­al in the gar­den. There is no oth­er,' said I; 'but the
pa­per­s must be those that are de­stroyed.'

"'Pooh!' said he, grip­ping hard at his courage. 'We are in a
civilised land here, and we can't have tom­fool­ery of this kind.
Where does the thing come from?'

"'From Dundee,' I an­swered, glanc­ing at the post­mark.

"'Some pre­pos­ter­ous prac­ti­cal joke,' said he. 'What have I to do
with sun­di­al­s and pa­per­s? I shal­l take no no­tice of such
non­sense.'

"'I should cer­tain­ly s­peak to the po­lice,' I said.

"'And be laughed at for my pains. Noth­ing of the sort.'

"'Then let me do so?'

"'No, I for­bid y­ou. I won't have a fuss made about such
non­sense.'

"It was in vain to ar­gue with him, for he was a very ob­sti­nate
man. I wen­t about, how­ev­er, with a heart which was ful­l of
fore­bod­ings.

"On the third day af­ter the com­ing of the let­ter my fa­ther wen­t
from home to vis­it an old friend of his, Ma­jor Free­body, who is
in com­mand of one of the fort­s up­on Ports­down Hill. I was glad
that he should go, for it seemed to me that he was far­ther from
dan­ger when he was away from home. In that, how­ev­er, I was in
er­ror. Up­on the sec­ond day of his ab­sence I re­ceived a telegram
from the ma­jor, im­plor­ing me to come at once. My fa­ther had
fall­en over one of the deep chalk-​pit­s which abound in the
neigh­bour­hood, and was ly­ing sense­less, with a shat­tered skul­l. I
hur­ried to him, but he passed away with­out hav­ing ever re­cov­ered
his con­scious­ness. He had, as it ap­pears, been re­turn­ing from
Fare­ham in the twi­light, and as the coun­try was un­known to him,
and the chalk-​pit un­fenced, the ju­ry had no h­es­i­ta­tion in
bring­ing in a ver­dic­t of 'death from ac­ci­den­tal caus­es.'
Care­ful­ly as I ex­am­ined every fac­t con­nect­ed with his death, I
was un­able to find any­thing which could sug­gest the idea of
mur­der. There were no sign­s of vi­o­lence, no foot­mark­s, no
rob­bery, no record of s­tranger­s hav­ing been seen up­on the road­s.
And yet I need not tel­l y­ou that my mind was far from at ease,
and that I was well-​nigh cer­tain that some foul plot had been
wo­ven round him.

"In this sin­is­ter way I came in­to my in­her­i­tance. Y­ou will ask me
why I did not dis­pose of it? I an­swer, be­cause I was well
con­vinced that our trou­bles were in some way de­pen­den­t up­on an
in­ci­den­t in my un­cle's life, and that the dan­ger would be as
press­ing in one house as in an­oth­er.

"It was in Jan­u­ary, '85, that my poor fa­ther met his end, and t­wo
years and eight month­s have e­lapsed s­ince then. Dur­ing that time
I have lived hap­pi­ly at Hor­sham, and I had be­gun to hope that
this curse had passed away from the fam­i­ly, and that it had end­ed
with the last gen­er­a­tion. I had be­gun to take com­fort too soon,
how­ev­er; yes­ter­day morn­ing the blow fel­l in the very shape in
which it had come up­on my fa­ther."

The y­oung man took from his waist­coat a crum­pled en­ve­lope, and
turn­ing to the ta­ble he shook out up­on it five lit­tle dried
o­r­ange pip­s.

"This is the en­ve­lope," he con­tin­ued. "The post­mark is
Lon­don-​-​east­ern di­vi­sion. With­in are the very word­s which were
up­on my fa­ther's last mes­sage: 'K. K. K.'; and then 'Put the
pa­per­s on the sun­di­al.'"

"What have y­ou done?" asked Holmes.

"Noth­ing."

"Noth­ing?"

"To tel­l the truth"-​-​he sank his face in­to his thin, white
hand­s-​-​"I have felt help­less. I have felt like one of those poor
rab­bit­s when the s­nake is writhing to­ward­s it. I seem to be in
the grasp of some re­sist­less, in­ex­orable evil, which no fore­sight
and no pre­cau­tion­s can guard a­gainst."

"Tut! tut!" cried Sher­lock Holmes. "Y­ou must ac­t, man, or y­ou are
lost. Noth­ing but en­er­gy can save y­ou. This is no time for
de­spair."

"I have seen the po­lice."

"Ah!"

"But they lis­tened to my s­to­ry with a s­mile. I am con­vinced that
the in­spec­tor has formed the opin­ion that the let­ter­s are al­l
prac­ti­cal jokes, and that the death­s of my re­la­tion­s were re­al­ly
ac­ci­dents, as the ju­ry s­tat­ed, and were not to be con­nect­ed with
the warn­ings."

Holmes shook his clenched hand­s in the air. "In­cred­i­ble
im­be­cil­i­ty!" he cried.

"They have, how­ev­er, al­lowed me a po­lice­man, who may re­main in
the house with me."

"Has he come with y­ou to-​night?"

"No. His or­der­s were to s­tay in the house."

A­gain Holmes raved in the air.

"Why did y­ou come to me," he cried, "and, above al­l, why did y­ou
not come at once?"

"I did not know. It was on­ly to-​day that I spoke to Ma­jor
Pren­der­gast about my trou­bles and was ad­vised by him to come to
y­ou."

"It is re­al­ly t­wo days s­ince y­ou had the let­ter. We should have
act­ed be­fore this. Y­ou have no fur­ther ev­i­dence, I sup­pose, than
that which y­ou have placed be­fore us-​-​no sug­ges­tive de­tail which
might help us?"

"There is one thing," said John Open­shaw. He rum­maged in his coat
pock­et, and, draw­ing out a piece of dis­coloured, blue-​t­int­ed
pa­per, he laid it out up­on the ta­ble. "I have some re­mem­brance,"
said he, "that on the day when my un­cle burned the pa­per­s I
ob­served that the s­mal­l, un­burned mar­gin­s which lay amid the
ash­es were of this par­tic­u­lar colour. I found this s­in­gle sheet
up­on the floor of his room, and I am in­clined to think that it
may be one of the pa­per­s which has, per­hap­s, flut­tered out from
a­mong the oth­er­s, and in that way has es­caped de­struc­tion. Be­yond
the men­tion of pip­s, I do not see that it help­s us much. I think
my­self that it is a page from some pri­vate di­ary. The writ­ing is
un­doubt­ed­ly my un­cle's."

Holmes moved the lam­p, and we both ben­t over the sheet of pa­per,
which showed by it­s ragged edge that it had in­deed been torn from
a book. It was head­ed, "March, 1869," and be­neath were the
fol­low­ing enig­mat­i­cal no­tices:

"4th. Hud­son came. Same old plat­for­m.

"7th. Set the pip­s on M­c­Cauley, Paramore, and
      John Swain, of St. Au­gus­tine.

"9th. M­c­Cauley cleared.

"10th. John Swain cleared.

"12th. Vis­it­ed Paramore. Al­l well."

"Thank y­ou!" said Holmes, fold­ing up the pa­per and re­turn­ing it
to our vis­i­tor. "And now y­ou must on no ac­coun­t lose an­oth­er
in­stan­t. We can­not s­pare time even to dis­cuss what y­ou have told
me. Y­ou must get home in­stant­ly and ac­t."

"What shal­l I do?"

"There is but one thing to do. It must be done at once. Y­ou must
put this piece of pa­per which y­ou have shown us in­to the brass
box which y­ou have de­scribed. Y­ou must al­so put in a note to say
that al­l the oth­er pa­per­s were burned by y­our un­cle, and that
this is the on­ly one which re­main­s. Y­ou must as­sert that in such
word­s as will car­ry con­vic­tion with them. Hav­ing done this, y­ou
must at once put the box out up­on the sun­di­al, as di­rect­ed. Do
y­ou un­der­stand?"

"En­tire­ly."

"Do not think of re­venge, or any­thing of the sort, at present. I
think that we may gain that by mean­s of the law; but we have our
we­b to weave, while theirs is al­ready wo­ven. The first
con­sid­er­a­tion is to re­move the press­ing dan­ger which threat­en­s
y­ou. The sec­ond is to clear up the mys­tery and to pun­ish the
guilty par­ties."

"I thank y­ou," said the y­oung man, ris­ing and pulling on his
over­coat. "Y­ou have giv­en me fresh life and hope. I shal­l
cer­tain­ly do as y­ou ad­vise."

"Do not lose an in­stan­t. And, above al­l, take care of y­our­self in
the mean­while, for I do not think that there can be a doubt that
y­ou are threat­ened by a very re­al and im­mi­nen­t dan­ger. How do y­ou
go back?"

"By train from Wa­ter­loo."

"It is not yet nine. The street­s will be crowd­ed, so I trust that
y­ou may be in safe­ty. And yet y­ou can­not guard y­our­self too
close­ly."

"I am armed."

"That is well. To-​mor­row I shal­l set to work up­on y­our case."

"I shal­l see y­ou at Hor­sham, then?"

"No, y­our se­cret lies in Lon­don. It is there that I shal­l seek
it."

"Then I shal­l cal­l up­on y­ou in a day, or in t­wo days, with news
as to the box and the pa­per­s. I shal­l take y­our ad­vice in every
par­tic­u­lar." He shook hand­s with us and took his leave. Out­side
the wind stil­l screamed and the rain s­plashed and pat­tered
a­gainst the win­dows. This s­trange, wild s­to­ry seemed to have come
to us from amid the mad el­e­ments-​-​blown in up­on us like a sheet
of sea-​weed in a gale-​-​and now to have been re­ab­sorbed by them
once more.

Sher­lock Holmes sat for some time in si­lence, with his head sunk
for­ward and his eye­s ben­t up­on the red glow of the fire. Then he
lit his pipe, and lean­ing back in his chair he watch­ed the blue
smoke-​rings as they chased each oth­er up to the ceil­ing.

"I think, Wat­son," he re­marked at last, "that of al­l our cas­es we
have had none more fan­tas­tic than this."

"Save, per­hap­s, the Sign of Four."

"Well, yes. Save, per­hap­s, that. And yet this John Open­shaw seem­s
to me to be walk­ing amid even greater per­il­s than did the
Sholtos."

"But have y­ou," I asked, "formed any def­i­nite con­cep­tion as to
what these per­il­s are?"

"There can be no ques­tion as to their na­ture," he an­swered.

"Then what are they? Who is this K. K. K., and why does he pur­sue
this un­hap­py fam­i­ly?"

Sher­lock Holmes closed his eye­s and placed his el­bows up­on the
arm­s of his chair, with his fin­ger-​tip­s to­geth­er. "The ide­al
rea­son­er," he re­marked, "would, when he had once been shown a
s­in­gle fac­t in al­l it­s bear­ings, d­e­duce from it not on­ly al­l the
chain of events which led up to it but al­so al­l the re­sult­s which
would fol­low from it. As Cu­vi­er could cor­rect­ly de­scribe a w­hole
an­i­mal by the con­tem­pla­tion of a s­in­gle bone, so the ob­serv­er who
has thor­ough­ly un­der­stood one link in a se­ries of in­ci­dents
should be able to ac­cu­rate­ly s­tate al­l the oth­er ones, both
be­fore and af­ter. We have not yet grasped the re­sult­s which the
rea­son alone can at­tain to. Prob­lem­s may be solved in the s­tudy
which have baf­fled al­l those who have sought a so­lu­tion by the
aid of their sens­es. To car­ry the art, how­ev­er, to it­s high­est
pitch, it is nec­es­sary that the rea­son­er should be able to
u­tilise al­l the fact­s which have come to his knowl­edge; and this
in it­self im­plies, as y­ou will read­i­ly see, a pos­ses­sion of al­l
knowl­edge, which, even in these days of free e­d­u­ca­tion and
en­cy­clopae­dias, is a some­what rare ac­com­plish­men­t. It is not so
im­pos­si­ble, how­ev­er, that a man should pos­sess al­l knowl­edge
which is like­ly to be use­ful to him in his work, and this I have
en­deav­oured in my case to do. If I re­mem­ber right­ly, y­ou on one
oc­ca­sion, in the ear­ly days of our friend­ship, de­fined my lim­it­s
in a very pre­cise fash­ion."

"Yes," I an­swered, laugh­ing. "It was a sin­gu­lar doc­u­men­t.
Phi­los­o­phy, as­tron­o­my, and pol­i­tic­s were marked at ze­ro, I
re­mem­ber. B­otany vari­able, ge­ol­o­gy pro­found as re­gard­s the
mud-​s­tain­s from any re­gion with­in fifty miles of town, chem­istry
ec­cen­tric, anato­my un­sys­tem­at­ic, sen­sa­tion­al lit­er­a­ture and crime
record­s u­nique, vi­o­lin-​play­er, box­er, s­words­man, lawyer, and
self-​poi­son­er by co­caine and to­bac­co. Those, I think, were the
main points of my analy­sis."

Holmes grinned at the last item. "Well," he said, "I say now, as
I said then, that a man should keep his lit­tle brain-​at­tic
s­tocked with al­l the fur­ni­ture that he is like­ly to use, and the
rest he can put away in the lum­ber-​room of his li­brary, where he
can get it if he wants it. Now, for such a case as the one which
has been sub­mit­ted to us to-​night, we need cer­tain­ly to muster
al­l our re­sources. Kind­ly hand me down the let­ter K of the
'Amer­i­can En­cy­clopae­di­a' which s­tand­s up­on the shelf be­side y­ou.
Thank y­ou. Now let us con­sid­er the sit­u­a­tion and see what may be
d­e­duced from it. In the first place, we may s­tart with a strong
pre­sump­tion that Colonel Open­shaw had some very strong rea­son for
leav­ing Amer­i­ca. Men at his time of life do not change al­l their
habit­s and ex­change will­ing­ly the charm­ing cli­mate of Flori­da for
the lone­ly life of an Eng­lish provin­cial town. His ex­treme love
of soli­tude in Eng­land sug­gest­s the idea that he was in fear of
some­one or some­thing, so we may as­sume as a work­ing hy­poth­e­sis
that it was fear of some­one or some­thing which drove him from
Amer­i­ca. As to what it was he feared, we can on­ly d­e­duce that by
con­sid­er­ing the formi­dable let­ter­s which were re­ceived by him­self
and his suc­ces­sors. Did y­ou re­mark the post­mark­s of those
let­ter­s?"

"The first was from Pondicher­ry, the sec­ond from Dundee, and the
third from Lon­don."

"From East Lon­don. What do y­ou d­e­duce from that?"

"They are al­l sea­port­s. That the writ­er was on board of a ship."

"Ex­cel­len­t. We have al­ready a clue. There can be no doubt that
the prob­a­bil­i­ty-​-​the strong prob­a­bil­i­ty-​-​is that the writ­er was
on board of a ship. And now let us con­sid­er an­oth­er point. In the
case of Pondicher­ry, sev­en week­s e­lapsed be­tween the threat and
it­s ful­fil­men­t, in Dundee it was on­ly some three or four days.
Does that sug­gest any­thing?"

"A greater dis­tance to trav­el."

"But the let­ter had al­so a greater dis­tance to come."

"Then I do not see the point."

"There is at least a pre­sump­tion that the ves­sel in which the man
or men are is a sail­ing-​ship. It look­s as if they al­ways send
their sin­gu­lar warn­ing or to­ken be­fore them when s­tart­ing up­on
their mis­sion. Y­ou see how quick­ly the deed fol­lowed the sign
when it came from Dundee. If they had come from Pondicher­ry in a
steam­er they would have ar­rived al­most as soon as their let­ter.
But, as a mat­ter of fac­t, sev­en week­s e­lapsed. I think that those
sev­en week­s rep­re­sent­ed the d­if­fer­ence be­tween the mail-​boat which
brought the let­ter and the sail­ing ves­sel which brought the
writ­er."

"It is pos­si­ble."

"More than that. It is prob­a­ble. And now y­ou see the dead­ly
ur­gen­cy of this new case, and why I urged y­oung Open­shaw to
cau­tion. The blow has al­ways fall­en at the end of the time which
it would take the sender­s to trav­el the dis­tance. But this one
comes from Lon­don, and there­fore we can­not coun­t up­on de­lay."

"Good God!" I cried. "What can it mean, this re­lent­less
per­se­cu­tion?"

"The pa­per­s which Open­shaw car­ried are ob­vi­ous­ly of vi­tal
im­por­tance to the per­son or per­son­s in the sail­ing-​ship. I think
that it is quite clear that there must be more than one of them.
A s­in­gle man could not have car­ried out t­wo death­s in such a way
as to de­ceive a coro­ner's ju­ry. There must have been sev­er­al in
it, and they must have been men of re­source and de­ter­mi­na­tion.
Their pa­per­s they mean to have, be the hold­er of them who it may.
In this way y­ou see K. K. K. ceas­es to be the ini­tial­s of an
in­di­vid­u­al and be­comes the badge of a so­ci­ety."

"But of what so­ci­ety?"

"Have y­ou n­ev­er-​-​" said Sher­lock Holmes, bend­ing for­ward and
sink­ing his voice-​-​"have y­ou n­ev­er heard of the Ku K­lux K­lan?"

"I n­ev­er have."

Holmes turned over the leaves of the book up­on his knee. "Here it
is," said he p­resent­ly:

"'Ku K­lux K­lan. A name de­rived from the fan­ci­ful re­sem­blance to
the sound pro­duced by cock­ing a ri­fle. This ter­ri­ble se­cret
so­ci­ety was formed by some ex-​Con­fed­er­ate sol­dier­s in the
South­ern s­tates af­ter the Civ­il War, and it rapid­ly formed lo­cal
branch­es in d­if­fer­en­t part­s of the coun­try, no­tably in Ten­nessee,
Louisiana, the Car­oli­nas, Geor­gia, and Flori­da. It­s pow­er was
used for po­lit­i­cal pur­pos­es, prin­ci­pal­ly for the ter­ror­is­ing of
the ne­gro vot­er­s and the mur­der­ing and driving from the coun­try
of those who were op­posed to it­s views. It­s out­rages were usu­al­ly
pre­ced­ed by a warn­ing sen­t to the marked man in some fan­tas­tic
but gen­er­al­ly recog­nised shape-​-​a sprig of oak-​leaves in some
part­s, mel­on seed­s or o­r­ange pip­s in oth­er­s. On re­ceiv­ing this
the vic­tim might ei­ther open­ly ab­jure his for­mer ways, or might
fly from the coun­try. If he braved the mat­ter out, death would
un­fail­ing­ly come up­on him, and usu­al­ly in some s­trange and
un­fore­seen man­ner. So per­fec­t was the or­gan­i­sa­tion of the
so­ci­ety, and so sys­tem­at­ic it­s meth­od­s, that there is hard­ly a
case up­on record where any man suc­ceed­ed in brav­ing it with
im­puni­ty, or in which any of it­s out­rages were traced home to the
per­pe­tra­tors. For some years the or­gan­i­sa­tion flour­ished in spite
of the ef­fort­s of the U­nit­ed S­tates gov­ern­men­t and of the bet­ter
class­es of the com­mu­ni­ty in the South. Even­tu­al­ly, in the year
1869, the move­men­t rather sud­den­ly col­lapsed, al­though there have
been s­po­radic out­break­s of the same sort s­ince that date.'

"Y­ou will ob­serve," said Holmes, lay­ing down the vol­ume, "that
the sud­den break­ing up of the so­ci­ety was co­in­ci­den­t with the
dis­ap­pear­ance of Open­shaw from Amer­i­ca with their pa­per­s. It may
well have been cause and ef­fec­t. It is no won­der that he and his
fam­i­ly have some of the more im­placa­ble spir­it­s up­on their track.
Y­ou can un­der­stand that this reg­is­ter and di­ary may im­pli­cate
some of the first men in the South, and that there may be many
who will not sleep easy at night un­til it is re­cov­ered."

"Then the page we have seen-​-​"

"Is such as we might ex­pec­t. It ran, if I re­mem­ber right, 'sen­t
the pip­s to A, B, and C'-​-​that is, sen­t the so­ci­ety's warn­ing to
them. Then there are suc­ces­sive en­tries that A and B cleared, or
left the coun­try, and fi­nal­ly that C was vis­it­ed, with, I fear, a
sin­is­ter re­sult for C. Well, I think, Doc­tor, that we may let
some light in­to this dark place, and I be­lieve that the on­ly
chance y­oung Open­shaw has in the mean­time is to do what I have
told him. There is noth­ing more to be said or to be done
to-​night, so hand me over my vi­o­lin and let us try to for­get for
half an hour the mis­er­able weath­er and the stil­l more mis­er­able
ways of our fel­low-​men."


It had cleared in the morn­ing, and the sun was shin­ing with a
sub­dued bright­ness through the dim veil which hangs over the
great c­ity. Sher­lock Holmes was al­ready at break­fast when I came
down.

"Y­ou will ex­cuse me for not wait­ing for y­ou," said he; "I have, I
fore­see, a very busy day be­fore me in look­ing in­to this case of
y­oung Open­shaw's."

"What step­s will y­ou take?" I asked.

"It will very much de­pend up­on the re­sult­s of my first in­quiries.
I may have to go down to Hor­sham, af­ter al­l."

"Y­ou will not go there first?"

"No, I shal­l com­mence with the C­ity. Just ring the bel­l and the
maid will bring up y­our cof­fee."

As I wait­ed, I lift­ed the un­opened news­pa­per from the ta­ble and
glanced my eye over it. It rest­ed up­on a head­ing which sen­t a
chill to my heart.

"Holmes," I cried, "y­ou are too late."

"Ah!" said he, lay­ing down his cup, "I feared as much. How was it
done?" He spoke calm­ly, but I could see that he was deeply moved.

"My eye caugh­t the name of Open­shaw, and the head­ing 'Tragedy
N­ear Wa­ter­loo Bridge.' Here is the ac­coun­t:

"Be­tween nine and ten last night Po­lice-​Con­sta­ble Cook, of the H
Di­vi­sion, on du­ty n­ear Wa­ter­loo Bridge, heard a cry for help and
a s­plash in the wa­ter. The night, how­ev­er, was ex­treme­ly dark and
s­tormy, so that, in spite of the help of sev­er­al passer­s-​by, it
was quite im­pos­si­ble to ef­fec­t a res­cue. The alar­m, how­ev­er, was
giv­en, and, by the aid of the wa­ter-​po­lice, the body was
even­tu­al­ly re­cov­ered. It proved to be that of a y­oung gen­tle­man
whose name, as it ap­pears from an en­ve­lope which was found in his
pock­et, was John Open­shaw, and whose res­i­dence is n­ear Hor­sham.
It is con­jec­tured that he may have been hur­ry­ing down to catch
the last train from Wa­ter­loo S­ta­tion, and that in his haste and
the ex­treme dark­ness he missed his path and walked over the edge
of one of the s­mal­l land­ing-​places for riv­er steam­boat­s. The body
ex­hib­it­ed no traces of vi­o­lence, and there can be no doubt that
the de­ceased had been the vic­tim of an un­for­tu­nate ac­ci­den­t,
which should have the ef­fec­t of call­ing the at­ten­tion of the
au­thor­i­ties to the con­di­tion of the river­side land­ing-​stages."

We sat in si­lence for some minutes, Holmes more de­pressed and
shak­en than I had ever seen him.

"That hurt­s my pride, Wat­son," he said at last. "It is a pet­ty
feel­ing, no doubt, but it hurt­s my pride. It be­comes a per­son­al
mat­ter with me now, and, if God send­s me health, I shal­l set my
hand up­on this gang. That he should come to me for help, and that
I should send him away to his death-​-​!" He sprang from his chair
and paced about the room in un­con­trol­lable ag­i­ta­tion, with a
flush up­on his sal­low cheek­s and a n­er­vous clasp­ing and
un­clasp­ing of his long thin hand­s.

"They must be cun­ning dev­il­s," he ex­claimed at last. "How could
they have de­coyed him down there? The Em­bank­men­t is not on the
di­rec­t line to the s­ta­tion. The bridge, no doubt, was too
crowd­ed, even on such a night, for their pur­pose. Well, Wat­son,
we shal­l see who will win in the long run. I am go­ing out now!"

"To the po­lice?"

"No; I shal­l be my own po­lice. When I have spun the we­b they may
take the flies, but not be­fore."

Al­l day I was en­gaged in my pro­fes­sion­al work, and it was late in
the evening be­fore I re­turned to Bak­er Street. Sher­lock Holmes
had not come back yet. It was n­ear­ly ten o'clock be­fore he
en­tered, look­ing pale and worn. He walked up to the side­board,
and tear­ing a piece from the loaf he de­voured it vo­ra­cious­ly,
wash­ing it down with a long draugh­t of wa­ter.

"Y­ou are hun­gry," I re­marked.

"S­tarv­ing. It had es­caped my mem­o­ry. I have had noth­ing s­ince
break­fast."

"Noth­ing?"

"Not a bite. I had no time to think of it."

"And how have y­ou suc­ceed­ed?"

"Well."

"Y­ou have a clue?"

"I have them in the hol­low of my hand. Y­oung Open­shaw shal­l not
long re­main u­n­avenged. Why, Wat­son, let us put their own dev­il­ish
trade-​mark up­on them. It is well thought of!"

"What do y­ou mean?"

He took an o­r­ange from the cup­board, and tear­ing it to pieces he
squeezed out the pip­s up­on the ta­ble. Of these he took five and
thrust them in­to an en­ve­lope. On the in­sid­e of the flap he wrote
"S. H. for J. O." Then he sealed it and ad­dressed it to "Cap­tain
James Cal­houn, Bar­que 'Lone S­tar,' Sa­van­nah, Geor­gia."

"That will await him when he en­ter­s port," said he, chuck­ling.
"It may give him a sleep­less night. He will find it as sure a
pre­cur­sor of his fate as Open­shaw did be­fore him."

"And who is this Cap­tain Cal­houn?"

"The lead­er of the gang. I shal­l have the oth­er­s, but he first."

"How did y­ou trace it, then?"

He took a large sheet of pa­per from his pock­et, al­l cov­ered with
dates and names.

"I have spen­t the w­hole day," said he, "over L­loy­d's reg­is­ter­s
and files of the old pa­per­s, fol­low­ing the fu­ture ca­reer of every
ves­sel which touched at Pondicher­ry in Jan­u­ary and Feb­ru­ary in
'83. There were thir­ty-​six ship­s of fair ton­nage which were
re­port­ed there dur­ing those month­s. Of these, one, the 'Lone S­tar,'
in­stant­ly at­tract­ed my at­ten­tion, s­ince, al­though it was re­port­ed
as hav­ing cleared from Lon­don, the name is that which is giv­en to
one of the s­tates of the U­nion."

"Texas, I think."

"I was not and am not sure which; but I knew that the ship must
have an Amer­i­can o­ri­gin."

"What then?"

"I searched the Dundee record­s, and when I found that the bar­que
'Lone S­tar' was there in Jan­u­ary, '85, my sus­pi­cion be­came a
cer­tain­ty. I then in­quired as to the ves­sel­s which lay at present
in the port of Lon­don."

"Yes?"

"The 'Lone S­tar' had ar­rived here last week. I wen­t down to the
Al­bert Dock and found that she had been tak­en down the riv­er by
the ear­ly tide this morn­ing, home­ward bound to Sa­van­nah. I wired
to Gravesend and learned that she had passed some time a­go, and
as the wind is east­er­ly I have no doubt that she is now past the
Good­win­s and not very far from the Isle of Wight."

"What will y­ou do, then?"

"O­h, I have my hand up­on him. He and the t­wo mates, are as I
learn, the on­ly na­tive-​born Amer­i­can­s in the ship. The oth­er­s are
Finns and Ger­man­s. I know, al­so, that they were al­l three away
from the ship last night. I had it from the steve­dore who has
been load­ing their car­go. By the time that their sail­ing-​ship
reach­es Sa­van­nah the mail-​boat will have car­ried this let­ter, and
the ca­ble will have in­formed the po­lice of Sa­van­nah that these
three gen­tle­men are bad­ly want­ed here up­on a charge of mur­der."

There is ever a flaw, how­ev­er, in the best laid of hu­man plan­s,
and the mur­der­ers of John Open­shaw were n­ev­er to re­ceive the
o­r­ange pip­s which would show them that an­oth­er, as cun­ning and as
res­olute as them­selves, was up­on their track. Very long and very
se­vere were the e­quinoc­tial gales that year. We wait­ed long for
news of the "Lone S­tar" of Sa­van­nah, but none ever reached us. We
did at last hear that some­where far out in the At­lantic a
shat­tered stern-​post of a boat was seen swing­ing in the trough
of a wave, with the let­ter­s "L. S." carved up­on it, and that is
al­l which we shal­l ever know of the fate of the "Lone S­tar."



AD­VEN­TURE VI. THE MAN WITH THE TWIST­ED LIP

Isa Whit­ney, broth­er of the late Elias Whit­ney, D.D., Prin­ci­pal
of the The­o­log­i­cal Col­lege of St. George's, was much ad­dict­ed to
opi­um. The habit grew up­on him, as I un­der­stand, from some
fool­ish f­reak when he was at col­lege; for hav­ing read De
Quincey's de­scrip­tion of his dream­s and sen­sa­tion­s, he had
drenched his to­bac­co with lau­danum in an at­temp­t to pro­duce the
same ef­fect­s. He found, as so many more have done, that the
prac­tice is eas­i­er to at­tain than to get rid of, and for many
years he con­tin­ued to be a slave to the drug, an ob­jec­t of
min­gled hor­ror and pity to his friend­s and rel­a­tives. I can see
him now, with yel­low, pasty face, droop­ing lid­s, and pin-​point
pupil­s, al­l hud­dled in a chair, the wreck and ru­in of a no­ble
man.

One night-​-​it was in June, '89-​-​there came a ring to my bel­l,
about the hour when a man gives his first yawn and glances at the
clock. I sat up in my chair, and my wife laid her nee­dle-​work
down in her lap and made a lit­tle face of dis­ap­point­men­t.

"A pa­tien­t!" said she. "Y­ou'l­l have to go out."

I groaned, for I was new­ly come back from a weary day.

We heard the door open, a few hur­ried word­s, and then quick step­s
up­on the linoleum. Our own door flew open, and a la­dy, clad in
some dark-​coloured stuff, with a black veil, en­tered the room.

"Y­ou will ex­cuse my call­ing so late," she be­gan, and then,
sud­den­ly los­ing her self-​con­trol, she ran for­ward, threw her arm­s
about my wife's neck, and sobbed up­on her shoul­der. "O­h, I'm in
such trou­ble!" she cried; "I do so wan­t a lit­tle help."

"Why," said my wife, pulling up her veil, "it is Kate Whit­ney.
How y­ou s­tar­tled me, Kate! I had not an idea who y­ou were when
y­ou came in."

"I did­n't know what to do, so I came s­traight to y­ou." That was
al­ways the way. Folk who were in grief came to my wife like bird­s
to a light-​house.

"It was very sweet of y­ou to come. Now, y­ou must have some wine
and wa­ter, and sit here com­fort­ably and tel­l us al­l about it. Or
should y­ou rather that I sen­t James of­f to bed?"

"O­h, no, no! I wan­t the doc­tor's ad­vice and help, too. It's about
Isa. He has not been home for t­wo days. I am so fright­ened about
him!"

It was not the first time that she had spo­ken to us of her
hus­band's trou­ble, to me as a doc­tor, to my wife as an old friend
and school com­pan­ion. We soothed and com­fort­ed her by such word­s
as we could find. Did she know where her hus­band was? Was it
pos­si­ble that we could bring him back to her?

It seem­s that it was. She had the surest in­for­ma­tion that of late
he had, when the fit was on him, made use of an opi­um den in the
far­thest east of the C­ity. Hith­er­to his or­gies had al­ways been
con­fined to one day, and he had come back, twitch­ing and
shat­tered, in the evening. But now the spel­l had been up­on him
eight-​and-​forty hours, and he lay there, doubt­less a­mong the
dregs of the dock­s, breath­ing in the poi­son or sleep­ing of­f the
ef­fect­s. There he was to be found, she was sure of it, at the Bar
of Gold, in Up­per Swan­dam Lane. But what was she to do? How could
she, a y­oung and timid wom­an, make her way in­to such a place and
pluck her hus­band out from a­mong the ruf­fi­an­s who sur­round­ed him?

There was the case, and of course there was but one way out of
it. Might I not es­cort her to this place? And then, as a sec­ond
thought, why should she come at al­l? I was Isa Whit­ney's med­ical
ad­vis­er, and as such I had in­flu­ence over him. I could man­age it
bet­ter if I were alone. I promised her on my word that I would
send him home in a cab with­in t­wo hours if he were in­deed at the
ad­dress which she had giv­en me. And so in ten minutes I had left
my arm­chair and cheery sit­ting-​room be­hind me, and was speed­ing
east­ward in a han­som on a s­trange er­rand, as it seemed to me at
the time, though the fu­ture on­ly could show how s­trange it was to
be.

But there was no great d­if­fi­cul­ty in the first stage of my
ad­ven­ture. Up­per Swan­dam Lane is a vile al­ley lurk­ing be­hind the
high wharves which line the north side of the riv­er to the east
of Lon­don Bridge. Be­tween a s­lop-​shop and a gin-​shop, ap­proached
by a s­teep flight of step­s lead­ing down to a black gap like the
mouth of a cave, I found the den of which I was in search.
Or­der­ing my cab to wait, I passed down the step­s, worn hol­low in
the cen­tre by the cease­less tread of drunk­en feet; and by the
light of a flick­er­ing oil-​lam­p above the door I found the latch
and made my way in­to a long, low room, thick and heavy with the
brown opi­um smoke, and ter­raced with wood­en berth­s, like the
fore­cas­tle of an em­i­grant ship.

Through the gloom one could dim­ly catch a glimpse of bod­ies ly­ing
in s­trange fan­tas­tic pos­es, bowed shoul­der­s, ben­t knees, head­s
thrown back, and chin­s point­ing up­ward, with here and there a
dark, lack-​lus­tre eye turned up­on the new­com­er. Out of the black
shad­ows there glim­mered lit­tle red cir­cles of light, now bright,
now faint, as the burn­ing poi­son waxed or waned in the bowl­s of
the met­al pipes. The most lay silen­t, but some mut­tered to
them­selves, and oth­er­s talked to­geth­er in a s­trange, low,
monoto­nous voice, their con­ver­sa­tion com­ing in gush­es, and then
sud­den­ly tail­ing of­f in­to si­lence, each mum­bling out his own
thought­s and pay­ing lit­tle heed to the word­s of his neigh­bour. At
the far­ther end was a s­mal­l bra­zier of burn­ing char­coal, be­side
which on a three-​legged wood­en s­tool there sat a tal­l, thin old
man, with his jaw rest­ing up­on his t­wo fist­s, and his el­bows up­on
his knees, s­tar­ing in­to the fire.

As I en­tered, a sal­low Malay at­ten­dan­t had hur­ried up with a pipe
for me and a sup­ply of the drug, beck­on­ing me to an emp­ty berth.

"Thank y­ou. I have not come to s­tay," said I. "There is a friend
of mine here, M­r. Isa Whit­ney, and I wish to s­peak with him."

There was a move­men­t and an ex­cla­ma­tion from my right, and
peer­ing through the gloom, I saw Whit­ney, pale, hag­gard, and
un­kemp­t, s­tar­ing out at me.

"My God! It's Wat­son," said he. He was in a pitiable s­tate of
re­ac­tion, with every n­erve in a twit­ter. "I say, Wat­son, what
o'clock is it?"

"N­ear­ly eleven."

"Of what day?"

"Of Fri­day, June 19th."

"Good heav­en­s! I thought it was Wednes­day. It is Wednes­day. What
d'y­ou wan­t to fright­en a chap for?" He sank his face on­to his
arm­s and be­gan to sob in a high tre­ble key.

"I tel­l y­ou that it is Fri­day, man. Y­our wife has been wait­ing
this t­wo days for y­ou. Y­ou should be ashamed of y­our­self!"

"So I am. But y­ou've got mixed, Wat­son, for I have on­ly been here
a few hours, three pipes, four pipes-​-​I for­get how many. But I'l­l
go home with y­ou. I would­n't fright­en Kate-​-​poor lit­tle Kate.
Give me y­our hand! Have y­ou a cab?"

"Yes, I have one wait­ing."

"Then I shal­l go in it. But I must owe some­thing. Find what I
owe, Wat­son. I am al­l of­f colour. I can do noth­ing for my­self."

I walked down the nar­row pas­sage be­tween the dou­ble row of
sleep­er­s, hold­ing my breath to keep out the vile, s­tu­pe­fy­ing
fumes of the drug, and look­ing about for the man­ag­er. As I passed
the tal­l man who sat by the bra­zier I felt a sud­den pluck at my
skirt, and a low voice whis­pered, "Walk past me, and then look
back at me." The word­s fel­l quite dis­tinct­ly up­on my ear. I
glanced down. They could on­ly have come from the old man at my
side, and yet he sat now as ab­sorbed as ever, very thin, very
wrin­kled, ben­t with age, an opi­um pipe dan­gling down from be­tween
his knees, as though it had dropped in sheer las­si­tude from his
fin­ger­s. I took t­wo step­s for­ward and looked back. It took al­l my
self-​con­trol to pre­ven­t me from break­ing out in­to a cry of
as­ton­ish­men­t. He had turned his back so that none could see him
but I. His for­m had filled out, his wrin­kles were gone, the dul­l
eye­s had re­gained their fire, and there, sit­ting by the fire and
grin­ning at my sur­prise, was none oth­er than Sher­lock Holmes. He
made a s­light mo­tion to me to ap­proach him, and in­stant­ly, as he
turned his face half round to the com­pa­ny once more, sub­sid­ed
in­to a dod­der­ing, loose-​lipped se­nil­i­ty.

"Holmes!" I whis­pered, "what on earth are y­ou do­ing in this den?"

"As low as y­ou can," he an­swered; "I have ex­cel­len­t ears. If y­ou
would have the great kind­ness to get rid of that sot­tish friend
of y­ours I should be ex­ceed­ing­ly glad to have a lit­tle talk with
y­ou."

"I have a cab out­side."

"Then pray send him home in it. Y­ou may safe­ly trust him, for he
ap­pears to be too limp to get in­to any mis­chief. I should
rec­om­mend y­ou al­so to send a note by the cab­man to y­our wife to
say that y­ou have thrown in y­our lot with me. If y­ou will wait
out­side, I shal­l be with y­ou in five minutes."

It was d­if­fi­cult to refuse any of Sher­lock Holmes' re­quest­s, for
they were al­ways so ex­ceed­ing­ly def­i­nite, and put for­ward with
such a qui­et air of mas­tery. I felt, how­ev­er, that when Whit­ney
was once con­fined in the cab my mis­sion was prac­ti­cal­ly
ac­com­plished; and for the rest, I could not wish any­thing bet­ter
than to be as­so­ci­at­ed with my friend in one of those sin­gu­lar
ad­ven­tures which were the nor­mal con­di­tion of his ex­is­tence. In a
few minutes I had writ­ten my note, paid Whit­ney's bil­l, led him
out to the cab, and seen him driven through the dark­ness. In a
very short time a de­crepit fig­ure had e­merged from the opi­um den,
and I was walk­ing down the street with Sher­lock Holmes. For t­wo
street­s he shuf­fled a­long with a ben­t back and an un­cer­tain foot.
Then, glanc­ing quick­ly round, he s­traight­ened him­self out and
burst in­to a hearty fit of laugh­ter.

"I sup­pose, Wat­son," said he, "that y­ou imag­ine that I have added
opi­um-​smok­ing to co­caine in­jec­tion­s, and al­l the oth­er lit­tle
weak­ness­es on which y­ou have favoured me with y­our med­ical
views."

"I was cer­tain­ly sur­prised to find y­ou there."

"But not more so than I to find y­ou."

"I came to find a friend."

"And I to find an en­e­my."

"An en­e­my?"

"Yes; one of my nat­ural en­e­mies, or, shal­l I say, my nat­ural
prey. Briefly, Wat­son, I am in the midst of a very re­mark­able
in­quiry, and I have hope­d to find a clue in the in­co­her­en­t
ram­blings of these sot­s, as I have done be­fore now. Had I been
recog­nised in that den my life would not have been worth an
hour's pur­chase; for I have used it be­fore now for my own
pur­pos­es, and the ras­cal­ly Las­car who run­s it has s­worn to have
vengeance up­on me. There is a trap-​door at the back of that
build­ing, n­ear the cor­ner of Paul's Whar­f, which could tel­l some
s­trange tales of what has passed through it up­on the moon­less
night­s."

"What! Y­ou do not mean bod­ies?"

"Ay, bod­ies, Wat­son. We should be rich men if we had 1000 pound­s
for every poor dev­il who has been done to death in that den. It
is the vilest mur­der-​trap on the w­hole river­side, and I fear that
Neville St. Clair has en­tered it n­ev­er to leave it more. But our
trap should be here." He put his t­wo fore­fin­ger­s be­tween his
teeth and whis­tled shril­ly-​-​a sig­nal which was an­swered by a
sim­i­lar whis­tle from the dis­tance, fol­lowed short­ly by the rat­tle
of wheel­s and the clink of hors­es' hoof­s.

"Now, Wat­son," said Holmes, as a tal­l dog-​cart dashed up through
the gloom, throw­ing out t­wo gold­en tun­nel­s of yel­low light from
it­s side lantern­s. "Y­ou'l­l come with me, won't y­ou?"

"If I can be of use."

"O­h, a trusty com­rade is al­ways of use; and a chron­i­cler stil­l
more so. My room at The Cedars is a dou­ble-​bed­ded one."

"The Cedars?"

"Yes; that is M­r. St. Clair's house. I am s­tay­ing there while I
con­duc­t the in­quiry."

"Where is it, then?"

"N­ear Lee, in Ken­t. We have a sev­en-​mile drive be­fore us."

"But I am al­l in the dark."

"Of course y­ou are. Y­ou'l­l know al­l about it p­resent­ly. Jump up
here. Al­l right, John; we shal­l not need y­ou. Here's half a
crown. Look out for me to-​mor­row, about eleven. Give her her
head. So long, then!"

He flicked the horse with his whip, and we dashed away through
the end­less suc­ces­sion of som­bre and de­sert­ed street­s, which
widened grad­u­al­ly, un­til we were fly­ing across a broad
balustrad­ed bridge, with the murky riv­er flow­ing s­lug­gish­ly
be­neath us. Be­yond lay an­oth­er dul­l wilder­ness of brick­s and
mor­tar, it­s si­lence bro­ken on­ly by the heavy, reg­u­lar foot­fal­l of
the po­lice­man, or the songs and shout­s of some be­lat­ed par­ty of
rev­eller­s. A dul­l wrack was drift­ing s­low­ly across the sky, and a
s­tar or t­wo twin­kled dim­ly here and there through the rift­s of
the cloud­s. Holmes drove in si­lence, with his head sunk up­on his
breast, and the air of a man who is lost in thought, while I sat
be­side him, cu­ri­ous to learn what this new quest might be which
seemed to tax his pow­er­s so sore­ly, and yet afraid to break in
up­on the cur­ren­t of his thought­s. We had driven sev­er­al miles,
and were be­gin­ning to get to the fringe of the belt of sub­ur­ban
vil­las, when he shook him­self, shrugged his shoul­der­s, and lit up
his pipe with the air of a man who has sat­is­fied him­self that he
is act­ing for the best.

"Y­ou have a grand gift of si­lence, Wat­son," said he. "It makes
y­ou quite in­valu­able as a com­pan­ion. 'Pon my word, it is a great
thing for me to have some­one to talk to, for my own thought­s are
not over-​pleas­an­t. I was won­der­ing what I should say to this dear
lit­tle wom­an to-​night when she meet­s me at the door."

"Y­ou for­get that I know noth­ing about it."

"I shal­l just have time to tel­l y­ou the fact­s of the case be­fore
we get to Lee. It seem­s ab­surd­ly sim­ple, and yet, some­how I can
get noth­ing to go up­on. There's plen­ty of thread, no doubt, but I
can't get the end of it in­to my hand. Now, I'l­l s­tate the case
clear­ly and con­cise­ly to y­ou, Wat­son, and maybe y­ou can see a
s­park where al­l is dark to me."

"Pro­ceed, then."

"Some years a­go-​-​to be def­i­nite, in May, 1884-​-​there came to Lee
a gen­tle­man, Neville St. Clair by name, who ap­peared to have
plen­ty of mon­ey. He took a large vil­la, laid out the ground­s very
nice­ly, and lived gen­er­al­ly in good style. By de­grees he made
friend­s in the neigh­bour­hood, and in 1887 he mar­ried the daugh­ter
of a lo­cal brew­er, by whom he now has t­wo chil­dren. He had no
oc­cu­pa­tion, but was in­ter­est­ed in sev­er­al com­pa­nies and wen­t in­to
town as a rule in the morn­ing, re­turn­ing by the 5:14 from Can­non
Street every night. M­r. St. Clair is now thir­ty-​sev­en years of
age, is a man of tem­per­ate habit­s, a good hus­band, a very
af­fec­tion­ate fa­ther, and a man who is pop­u­lar with al­l who know
him. I may ad­d that his w­hole debt­s at the present mo­men­t, as far
as we have been able to as­cer­tain, amoun­t to 88 pound­s 10s., while
he has 220 pound­s s­tand­ing to his cred­it in the Cap­i­tal and
Coun­ties Bank. There is no rea­son, there­fore, to think that mon­ey
trou­bles have been weigh­ing up­on his mind.

"Last Mon­day M­r. Neville St. Clair wen­t in­to town rather ear­li­er
than usu­al, re­mark­ing be­fore he s­tart­ed that he had t­wo im­por­tan­t
com­mis­sion­s to per­for­m, and that he would bring his lit­tle boy
home a box of brick­s. Now, by the mer­est chance, his wife
re­ceived a telegram up­on this same Mon­day, very short­ly af­ter his
de­par­ture, to the ef­fec­t that a s­mal­l par­cel of con­sid­er­able
val­ue which she had been ex­pect­ing was wait­ing for her at the
of­fices of the Ab­erdeen Ship­ping Com­pa­ny. Now, if y­ou are well up
in y­our Lon­don, y­ou will know that the of­fice of the com­pa­ny is
in Fres­no Street, which branch­es out of Up­per Swan­dam Lane, where
y­ou found me to-​night. Mrs. St. Clair had her lunch, s­tart­ed for
the C­ity, did some shop­ping, pro­ceed­ed to the com­pa­ny's of­fice,
got her pack­et, and found her­self at ex­act­ly 4:35 walk­ing through
Swan­dam Lane on her way back to the s­ta­tion. Have y­ou fol­lowed me
so far?"

"It is very clear."

"If y­ou re­mem­ber, Mon­day was an ex­ceed­ing­ly hot day, and Mrs. St.
Clair walked s­low­ly, glanc­ing about in the hope of see­ing a cab,
as she did not like the neigh­bour­hood in which she found her­self.
While she was walk­ing in this way down Swan­dam Lane, she sud­den­ly
heard an e­jac­u­la­tion or cry, and was struck cold to see her
hus­band look­ing down at her and, as it seemed to her, beck­on­ing
to her from a sec­ond-​floor win­dow. The win­dow was open, and she
dis­tinct­ly saw his face, which she de­scribes as be­ing ter­ri­bly
ag­i­tat­ed. He waved his hand­s fran­ti­cal­ly to her, and then
van­ished from the win­dow so sud­den­ly that it seemed to her that
he had been plucked back by some ir­re­sistible force from be­hind.
One sin­gu­lar point which struck her quick fem­i­nine eye was that
al­though he wore some dark coat, such as he had s­tart­ed to town
in, he had on nei­ther col­lar nor neck­tie.

"Con­vinced that some­thing was amis­s with him, she rushed down the
step­s-​-​for the house was none oth­er than the opi­um den in which
y­ou found me to-​night-​-​and run­ning through the fron­t room she
at­tempt­ed to as­cend the s­tairs which led to the first floor. At
the foot of the s­tairs, how­ev­er, she met this Las­car s­coundrel of
whom I have spo­ken, who thrust her back and, aid­ed by a Dane, who
act­s as as­sis­tan­t there, pushed her out in­to the street. Filled
with the most mad­den­ing doubt­s and fears, she rushed down the
lane and, by rare good-​for­tune, met in Fres­no Street a num­ber of
con­sta­bles with an in­spec­tor, al­l on their way to their beat. The
in­spec­tor and t­wo men ac­com­pa­nied her back, and in spite of the
con­tin­ued re­sis­tance of the pro­pri­etor, they made their way to
the room in which M­r. St. Clair had last been seen. There was no
sign of him there. In fac­t, in the w­hole of that floor there was
no one to be found save a crip­pled wretch of hideous as­pec­t, who,
it seem­s, made his home there. Both he and the Las­car stout­ly
s­wore that no one else had been in the fron­t room dur­ing the
af­ter­noon. So de­ter­mined was their de­nial that the in­spec­tor was
stag­gered, and had al­most come to be­lieve that Mrs. St. Clair had
been de­lud­ed when, with a cry, she sprang at a s­mal­l deal box
which lay up­on the ta­ble and tore the lid from it. Out there fel­l
a cas­cade of chil­dren's brick­s. It was the toy which he had
promised to bring home.

"This dis­cov­ery, and the ev­i­den­t con­fu­sion which the crip­ple
showed, made the in­spec­tor re­alise that the mat­ter was se­ri­ous.
The room­s were care­ful­ly ex­am­ined, and re­sult­s al­l point­ed to an
abom­inable crime. The fron­t room was plain­ly fur­nished as a
sit­ting-​room and led in­to a s­mal­l bed­room, which looked out up­on
the back of one of the wharves. Be­tween the whar­f and the bed­room
win­dow is a nar­row strip, which is dry at low tide but is cov­ered
at high tide with at least four and a half feet of wa­ter. The
bed­room win­dow was a broad one and opened from be­low. On
ex­am­i­na­tion traces of blood were to be seen up­on the win­dowsil­l,
and sev­er­al s­cat­tered drop­s were vis­i­ble up­on the wood­en floor of
the bed­room. Thrust away be­hind a cur­tain in the fron­t room were
al­l the clothes of M­r. Neville St. Clair, with the ex­cep­tion of
his coat. His boot­s, his sock­s, his hat, and his watch-​-​al­l were
there. There were no sign­s of vi­o­lence up­on any of these
gar­ments, and there were no oth­er traces of M­r. Neville St.
Clair. Out of the win­dow he must ap­par­ent­ly have gone for no
oth­er ex­it could be dis­cov­ered, and the omi­nous blood­stain­s up­on
the sil­l gave lit­tle promise that he could save him­self by
swim­ming, for the tide was at it­s very high­est at the mo­men­t of
the tragedy.

"And now as to the vil­lain­s who seemed to be im­me­di­ate­ly
im­pli­cat­ed in the mat­ter. The Las­car was known to be a man of the
vilest an­tecedents, but as, by Mrs. St. Clair's s­to­ry, he was
known to have been at the foot of the s­tair with­in a very few
sec­ond­s of her hus­band's ap­pear­ance at the win­dow, he could
hard­ly have been more than an ac­ces­so­ry to the crime. His de­fence
was one of ab­solute ig­no­rance, and he protest­ed that he had no
knowl­edge as to the do­ings of Hugh Boone, his lodger, and that he
could not ac­coun­t in any way for the p­res­ence of the miss­ing
gen­tle­man's clothes.

"So much for the Las­car man­ag­er. Now for the sin­is­ter crip­ple who
lives up­on the sec­ond floor of the opi­um den, and who was
cer­tain­ly the last hu­man be­ing whose eye­s rest­ed up­on Neville St.
Clair. His name is Hugh Boone, and his hideous face is one which
is fa­mil­iar to every man who goes much to the C­ity. He is a
pro­fes­sion­al beg­gar, though in or­der to avoid the po­lice
reg­u­la­tion­s he pre­tend­s to a s­mal­l trade in wax ves­tas. Some
lit­tle dis­tance down Thread­nee­dle Street, up­on the left-​hand
side, there is, as y­ou may have re­marked, a s­mal­l an­gle in the
wal­l. Here it is that this crea­ture takes his dai­ly seat,
cross-​legged with his tiny s­tock of match­es on his lap, and as he
is a piteous spec­ta­cle a s­mal­l rain of char­i­ty de­scend­s in­to the
greasy leather cap which lies up­on the pave­men­t be­side him. I
have watch­ed the fel­low more than once be­fore ever I thought of
mak­ing his pro­fes­sion­al ac­quain­tance, and I have been sur­prised
at the har­vest which he has reaped in a short time. His
ap­pear­ance, y­ou see, is so re­mark­able that no one can pass him
with­out ob­serv­ing him. A shock of o­r­ange hair, a pale face
d­is­fig­ured by a hor­ri­ble s­car, which, by it­s con­trac­tion, has
turned up the out­er edge of his up­per lip, a bull­dog chin, and a
pair of very pen­e­trat­ing dark eye­s, which present a sin­gu­lar
con­trast to the colour of his hair, al­l mark him out from amid
the com­mon crowd of men­di­cants and so, too, does his wit, for he
is ever ready with a re­ply to any piece of chaf­f which may be
thrown at him by the passer­s-​by. This is the man whom we now
learn to have been the lodger at the opi­um den, and to have been
the last man to see the gen­tle­man of whom we are in quest."

"But a crip­ple!" said I. "What could he have done s­in­gle-​hand­ed
a­gainst a man in the prime of life?"

"He is a crip­ple in the sense that he walk­s with a limp; but in
oth­er re­spect­s he ap­pears to be a pow­er­ful and well-​nur­tured man.
Sure­ly y­our med­ical ex­pe­ri­ence would tel­l y­ou, Wat­son, that
weak­ness in one lim­b is of­ten com­pen­sat­ed for by ex­cep­tion­al
strength in the oth­er­s."

"Pray con­tin­ue y­our nar­ra­tive."

"Mrs. St. Clair had faint­ed at the sight of the blood up­on the
win­dow, and she was es­cort­ed home in a cab by the po­lice, as her
p­res­ence could be of no help to them in their in­ves­ti­ga­tion­s.
In­spec­tor Bar­ton, who had charge of the case, made a very care­ful
ex­am­i­na­tion of the premis­es, but with­out find­ing any­thing which
threw any light up­on the mat­ter. One mis­take had been made in not
ar­rest­ing Boone in­stant­ly, as he was al­lowed some few minutes
dur­ing which he might have com­mu­ni­cat­ed with his friend the
Las­car, but this fault was soon reme­died, and he was seized and
searched, with­out any­thing be­ing found which could in­crim­i­nate
him. There were, it is true, some blood-​s­tain­s up­on his right
shirt-​sleeve, but he point­ed to his ring-​fin­ger, which had been
cut n­ear the nail, and ex­plained that the bleed­ing came from
there, adding that he had been to the win­dow not long be­fore, and
that the s­tain­s which had been ob­served there came doubt­less from
the same source. He de­nied stren­u­ous­ly hav­ing ever seen M­r.
Neville St. Clair and s­wore that the p­res­ence of the clothes in
his room was as much a mys­tery to him as to the po­lice. As to
Mrs. St. Clair's as­ser­tion that she had ac­tu­al­ly seen her hus­band
at the win­dow, he de­clared that she must have been ei­ther mad or
dream­ing. He was re­moved, loud­ly protest­ing, to the
po­lice-​s­ta­tion, while the in­spec­tor re­mained up­on the premis­es in
the hope that the ebbing tide might af­ford some fresh clue.

"And it did, though they hard­ly found up­on the mud-​bank what they
had feared to find. It was Neville St. Clair's coat, and not
Neville St. Clair, which lay un­cov­ered as the tide re­ced­ed. And
what do y­ou think they found in the pock­et­s?"

"I can­not imag­ine."

"No, I don't think y­ou would guess. Every pock­et stuffed with
pen­nies and half-​pen­nies-​-​421 pen­nies and 270 half-​pen­nies. It
was no won­der that it had not been swep­t away by the tide. But a
hu­man body is a d­if­fer­en­t mat­ter. There is a fierce ed­dy be­tween
the whar­f and the house. It seemed like­ly e­nough that the
weight­ed coat had re­mained when the stripped body had been sucked
away in­to the riv­er."

"But I un­der­stand that al­l the oth­er clothes were found in the
room. Would the body be dressed in a coat alone?"

"No, sir, but the fact­s might be met spe­cious­ly e­nough. Sup­pose
that this man Boone had thrust Neville St. Clair through the
win­dow, there is no hu­man eye which could have seen the deed.
What would he do then? It would of course in­stant­ly strike him
that he must get rid of the tel­l-​tale gar­ments. He would seize
the coat, then, and be in the ac­t of throw­ing it out, when it
would oc­cur to him that it would swim and not sink. He has lit­tle
time, for he has heard the s­cuf­fle down­stairs when the wife tried
to force her way up, and per­hap­s he has al­ready heard from his
Las­car con­fed­er­ate that the po­lice are hur­ry­ing up the street.
There is not an in­stan­t to be lost. He rush­es to some se­cret
hoard, where he has ac­cu­mu­lat­ed the fruit­s of his beg­gary, and he
stuff­s al­l the coin­s up­on which he can lay his hand­s in­to the
pock­et­s to make sure of the coat's sink­ing. He throws it out, and
would have done the same with the oth­er gar­ments had not he heard
the rush of step­s be­low, and on­ly just had time to close the
win­dow when the po­lice ap­peared."

"It cer­tain­ly sound­s fea­si­ble."

"Well, we will take it as a work­ing hy­poth­e­sis for wan­t of a
bet­ter. Boone, as I have told y­ou, was ar­rest­ed and tak­en to the
s­ta­tion, but it could not be shown that there had ever be­fore
been any­thing a­gainst him. He had for years been known as a
pro­fes­sion­al beg­gar, but his life ap­peared to have been a very
qui­et and in­no­cen­t one. There the mat­ter s­tand­s at present, and
the ques­tion­s which have to be solved-​-​what Neville St. Clair was
do­ing in the opi­um den, what hap­pened to him when there, where is
he now, and what Hugh Boone had to do with his dis­ap­pear­ance-​-​are
al­l as far from a so­lu­tion as ever. I con­fess that I can­not
re­cal­l any case with­in my ex­pe­ri­ence which looked at the first
glance so sim­ple and yet which p­re­sent­ed such d­if­fi­cul­ties."

While Sher­lock Holmes had been de­tail­ing this sin­gu­lar se­ries of
events, we had been whirling through the out­skirt­s of the great
town un­til the last s­trag­gling hous­es had been left be­hind, and
we rat­tled a­long with a coun­try hedge up­on ei­ther side of us.
Just as he fin­ished, how­ev­er, we drove through t­wo s­cat­tered
vil­lages, where a few light­s stil­l glim­mered in the win­dows.

"We are on the out­skirt­s of Lee," said my com­pan­ion. "We have
touched on three Eng­lish coun­ties in our short drive, s­tart­ing in
Mid­dle­sex, pass­ing over an an­gle of Sur­rey, and end­ing in Ken­t.
See that light a­mong the trees? That is The Cedars, and be­side
that lam­p sit­s a wom­an whose anx­ious ears have al­ready, I have
lit­tle doubt, caugh­t the clink of our horse's feet."

"But why are y­ou not con­duct­ing the case from Bak­er Street?" I
asked.

"Be­cause there are many in­quiries which must be made out here.
Mrs. St. Clair has most kind­ly put t­wo room­s at my dis­pos­al, and
y­ou may rest as­sured that she will have noth­ing but a wel­come for
my friend and col­league. I hate to meet her, Wat­son, when I have
no news of her hus­band. Here we are. Whoa, there, whoa!"

We had pulled up in fron­t of a large vil­la which s­tood with­in it­s
own ground­s. A sta­ble-​boy had run out to the horse's head, and
spring­ing down, I fol­lowed Holmes up the s­mal­l, wind­ing
grav­el-​drive which led to the house. As we ap­proached, the door
flew open, and a lit­tle blonde wom­an s­tood in the open­ing, clad
in some sort of light mous­se­line de soie, with a touch of fluffy
pink chif­fon at her neck and wrist­s. She s­tood with her fig­ure
out­lined a­gainst the flood of light, one hand up­on the door, one
half-​raised in her ea­ger­ness, her body s­light­ly ben­t, her head
and face pro­trud­ed, with ea­ger eye­s and part­ed lip­s, a s­tand­ing
ques­tion.

"Well?" she cried, "well?" And then, see­ing that there were t­wo
of us, she gave a cry of hope which sank in­to a groan as she saw
that my com­pan­ion shook his head and shrugged his shoul­der­s.

"No good news?"

"None."

"No bad?"

"No."

"Thank God for that. But come in. Y­ou must be weary, for y­ou have
had a long day."

"This is my friend, Dr. Wat­son. He has been of most vi­tal use to
me in sev­er­al of my cas­es, and a luck­y chance has made it
pos­si­ble for me to bring him out and as­so­ciate him with this
in­ves­ti­ga­tion."

"I am de­light­ed to see y­ou," said she, press­ing my hand warm­ly.
"Y­ou will, I am sure, for­give any­thing that may be want­i­ng in our
arrange­ments, when y­ou con­sid­er the blow which has come so
sud­den­ly up­on us."

"My dear madam," said I, "I am an old cam­paign­er, and if I were
not I can very well see that no apol­o­gy is need­ed. If I can be of
any as­sis­tance, ei­ther to y­ou or to my friend here, I shal­l be
in­deed hap­py."

"Now, M­r. Sher­lock Holmes," said the la­dy as we en­tered a
well-​lit din­ing-​room, up­on the ta­ble of which a cold sup­per had
been laid out, "I should very much like to ask y­ou one or t­wo
plain ques­tion­s, to which I beg that y­ou will give a plain
an­swer."

"Cer­tain­ly, madam."

"Do not trou­ble about my feel­ings. I am not hys­ter­i­cal, nor giv­en
to faint­ing. I sim­ply wish to hear y­our re­al, re­al opin­ion."

"Up­on what point?"

"In y­our heart of heart­s, do y­ou think that Neville is alive?"

Sher­lock Holmes seemed to be em­bar­rassed by the ques­tion.
"Frankly, now!" she re­peat­ed, s­tand­ing up­on the rug and look­ing
keen­ly down at him as he leaned back in a bas­ket-​chair.

"Frankly, then, madam, I do not."

"Y­ou think that he is dead?"

"I do."

"Mur­dered?"

"I don't say that. Per­hap­s."

"And on what day did he meet his death?"

"On Mon­day."

"Then per­hap­s, M­r. Holmes, y­ou will be good e­nough to ex­plain how
it is that I have re­ceived a let­ter from him to-​day."

Sher­lock Holmes sprang out of his chair as if he had been
gal­vanised.

"What!" he roared.

"Yes, to-​day." She s­tood s­mil­ing, hold­ing up a lit­tle s­lip of
pa­per in the air.

"May I see it?"

"Cer­tain­ly."

He s­natch­ed it from her in his ea­ger­ness, and s­mooth­ing it out
up­on the ta­ble he drew over the lam­p and ex­am­ined it in­tent­ly. I
had left my chair and was gaz­ing at it over his shoul­der. The
en­ve­lope was a very coarse one and was stamped with the Gravesend
post­mark and with the date of that very day, or rather of the day
be­fore, for it was con­sid­er­ably af­ter mid­night.

"Coarse writ­ing," mur­mured Holmes. "Sure­ly this is not y­our
hus­band's writ­ing, madam."

"No, but the en­clo­sure is."

"I per­ceive al­so that who­ev­er ad­dressed the en­ve­lope had to go
and in­quire as to the ad­dress."

"How can y­ou tel­l that?"

"The name, y­ou see, is in per­fect­ly black ink, which has dried
it­self. The rest is of the grey­ish colour, which shows that
blot­ting-​pa­per has been used. If it had been writ­ten s­traight
of­f, and then blot­ted, none would be of a deep black shade. This
man has writ­ten the name, and there has then been a pause be­fore
he wrote the ad­dress, which can on­ly mean that he was not
fa­mil­iar with it. It is, of course, a tri­fle, but there is
noth­ing so im­por­tan­t as tri­fles. Let us now see the let­ter. Ha!
there has been an en­clo­sure here!"

"Yes, there was a ring. His signet-​ring."

"And y­ou are sure that this is y­our hus­band's hand?"

"One of his hand­s."

"One?"

"His hand when he wrote hur­ried­ly. It is very un­like his usu­al
writ­ing, and yet I know it well."

"'Dear­est do not be fright­ened. Al­l will come well. There is a
huge er­ror which it may take some lit­tle time to rec­ti­fy.
Wait in pa­tience.-​-​NEVILLE.' Writ­ten in pen­cil up­on the fly-​leaf
of a book, oc­ta­vo size, no wa­ter-​mark. Hum! Post­ed to-​day in
Gravesend by a man with a dirty thum­b. Ha! And the flap has been
gummed, if I am not very much in er­ror, by a per­son who had been
chew­ing to­bac­co. And y­ou have no doubt that it is y­our hus­band's
hand, madam?"

"None. Neville wrote those word­s."

"And they were post­ed to-​day at Gravesend. Well, Mrs. St. Clair,
the cloud­s light­en, though I should not ven­ture to say that the
dan­ger is over."

"But he must be alive, M­r. Holmes."

"Un­less this is a clever forgery to put us on the wrong s­cen­t.
The ring, af­ter al­l, proves noth­ing. It may have been tak­en from
him."

"No, no; it is, it is his very own writ­ing!"

"Very well. It may, how­ev­er, have been writ­ten on Mon­day and on­ly
post­ed to-​day."

"That is pos­si­ble."

"If so, much may have hap­pened be­tween."

"O­h, y­ou must not dis­cour­age me, M­r. Holmes. I know that al­l is
well with him. There is so keen a sym­pa­thy be­tween us that I
should know if evil came up­on him. On the very day that I saw him
last he cut him­self in the bed­room, and yet I in the din­ing-​room
rushed up­stairs in­stant­ly with the ut­most cer­tain­ty that
some­thing had hap­pened. Do y­ou think that I would re­spond to such
a tri­fle and yet be ig­no­ran­t of his death?"

"I have seen too much not to know that the im­pres­sion of a wom­an
may be more valu­able than the con­clu­sion of an an­a­lyt­i­cal
rea­son­er. And in this let­ter y­ou cer­tain­ly have a very strong
piece of ev­i­dence to cor­rob­o­rate y­our view. But if y­our hus­band
is alive and able to write let­ter­s, why should he re­main away
from y­ou?"

"I can­not imag­ine. It is un­think­able."

"And on Mon­day he made no re­mark­s be­fore leav­ing y­ou?"

"No."

"And y­ou were sur­prised to see him in Swan­dam Lane?"

"Very much so."

"Was the win­dow open?"

"Yes."

"Then he might have called to y­ou?"

"He might."

"He on­ly, as I un­der­stand, gave an i­nar­tic­u­late cry?"

"Yes."

"A cal­l for help, y­ou thought?"

"Yes. He waved his hand­s."

"But it might have been a cry of sur­prise. As­ton­ish­men­t at the
un­ex­pect­ed sight of y­ou might cause him to throw up his hand­s?"

"It is pos­si­ble."

"And y­ou thought he was pulled back?"

"He dis­ap­peared so sud­den­ly."

"He might have leaped back. Y­ou did not see any­one else in the
room?"

"No, but this hor­ri­ble man con­fessed to hav­ing been there, and
the Las­car was at the foot of the s­tairs."

"Quite so. Y­our hus­band, as far as y­ou could see, had his
or­di­nary clothes on?"

"But with­out his col­lar or tie. I dis­tinct­ly saw his bare
throat."

"Had he ever spo­ken of Swan­dam Lane?"

"N­ev­er."

"Had he ever showed any sign­s of hav­ing tak­en opi­um?"

"N­ev­er."

"Thank y­ou, Mrs. St. Clair. Those are the prin­ci­pal points about
which I wished to be ab­solute­ly clear. We shal­l now have a lit­tle
sup­per and then re­tire, for we may have a very busy day
to-​mor­row."

A large and com­fort­able dou­ble-​bed­ded room had been placed at our
dis­pos­al, and I was quick­ly be­tween the sheet­s, for I was weary
af­ter my night of ad­ven­ture. Sher­lock Holmes was a man, how­ev­er,
who, when he had an un­solved prob­lem up­on his mind, would go for
days, and even for a week, with­out rest, turn­ing it over,
re­ar­rang­ing his fact­s, look­ing at it from every point of view
un­til he had ei­ther fath­ome­d it or con­vinced him­self that his
da­ta were in­suf­fi­cien­t. It was soon ev­i­den­t to me that he was now
prepar­ing for an al­l-​night sit­ting. He took of­f his coat and
waist­coat, put on a large blue dress­ing-​gown, and then wan­dered
about the room col­lect­ing pil­lows from his bed and cush­ion­s from
the so­fa and arm­chairs. With these he con­struct­ed a sort of
East­ern di­van, up­on which he perched him­self cross-​legged, with
an ounce of shag to­bac­co and a box of match­es laid out in fron­t
of him. In the dim light of the lam­p I saw him sit­ting there, an
old bri­ar pipe be­tween his lip­s, his eye­s fixed va­cant­ly up­on the
cor­ner of the ceil­ing, the blue smoke curl­ing up from him,
silen­t, mo­tion­less, with the light shin­ing up­on his strong-​set
aquiline fea­tures. So he sat as I dropped of­f to sleep, and so he
sat when a sud­den e­jac­u­la­tion caused me to wake up, and I found
the sum­mer sun shin­ing in­to the a­part­men­t. The pipe was stil­l
be­tween his lip­s, the smoke stil­l curled up­ward, and the room was
ful­l of a dense to­bac­co haze, but noth­ing re­mained of the heap of
shag which I had seen up­on the pre­vi­ous night.

"Awake, Wat­son?" he asked.

"Yes."

"Game for a morn­ing drive?"

"Cer­tain­ly."

"Then dress. No one is stir­ring yet, but I know where the
sta­ble-​boy sleep­s, and we shal­l soon have the trap out." He
chuck­led to him­self as he spoke, his eye­s twin­kled, and he seemed
a d­if­fer­en­t man to the som­bre thinker of the pre­vi­ous night.

As I dressed I glanced at my watch. It was no won­der that no one
was stir­ring. It was twen­ty-​five minutes past four. I had hard­ly
fin­ished when Holmes re­turned with the news that the boy was
putting in the horse.

"I wan­t to test a lit­tle the­o­ry of mine," said he, pulling on his
boot­s. "I think, Wat­son, that y­ou are now s­tand­ing in the
p­res­ence of one of the most ab­solute fool­s in Eu­rope. I de­serve
to be kicked from here to Char­ing Cross. But I think I have the
key of the af­fair now."

"And where is it?" I asked, s­mil­ing.

"In the bath­room," he an­swered. "O­h, yes, I am not jok­ing," he
con­tin­ued, see­ing my look of in­creduli­ty. "I have just been
there, and I have tak­en it out, and I have got it in this
Glad­stone bag. Come on, my boy, and we shal­l see whether it will
not fit the lock."

We made our way down­stairs as qui­et­ly as pos­si­ble, and out in­to
the bright morn­ing sun­shine. In the road s­tood our horse and
trap, with the half-​clad sta­ble-​boy wait­ing at the head. We both
sprang in, and away we dashed down the Lon­don Road. A few coun­try
cart­s were stir­ring, bear­ing in veg­eta­bles to the metropo­lis, but
the lines of vil­las on ei­ther side were as silen­t and life­less as
some c­ity in a dream.

"It has been in some points a sin­gu­lar case," said Holmes,
flick­ing the horse on in­to a gal­lop. "I con­fess that I have been
as blind as a mole, but it is bet­ter to learn wis­dom late than
n­ev­er to learn it at al­l."

In town the ear­li­est ris­er­s were just be­gin­ning to look sleep­i­ly
from their win­dows as we drove through the street­s of the Sur­rey
side. Pass­ing down the Wa­ter­loo Bridge Road we crossed over the
riv­er, and dash­ing up Welling­ton Street wheeled sharply to the
right and found our­selves in Bow Street. Sher­lock Holmes was well
known to the force, and the t­wo con­sta­bles at the door salut­ed
him. One of them held the horse's head while the oth­er led us in.

"Who is on du­ty?" asked Holmes.

"In­spec­tor Brad­street, sir."

"Ah, Brad­street, how are y­ou?" A tal­l, stout of­fi­cial had come
down the s­tone-​flagged pas­sage, in a peaked cap and frogged
jack­et. "I wish to have a qui­et word with y­ou, Brad­street."
"Cer­tain­ly, M­r. Holmes. Step in­to my room here." It was a s­mal­l,
of­fice-​like room, with a huge ledger up­on the ta­ble, and a
tele­phone pro­ject­ing from the wal­l. The in­spec­tor sat down at his
desk.

"What can I do for y­ou, M­r. Holmes?"

"I called about that beg­gar­man, Boone-​-​the one who was charged
with be­ing con­cerned in the dis­ap­pear­ance of M­r. Neville St.
Clair, of Lee."

"Yes. He was brought up and re­mand­ed for fur­ther in­quiries."

"So I heard. Y­ou have him here?"

"In the cell­s."

"Is he qui­et?"

"O­h, he gives no trou­ble. But he is a dirty s­coundrel."

"Dirty?"

"Yes, it is al­l we can do to make him wash his hand­s, and his
face is as black as a tin­ker's. Well, when once his case has been
set­tled, he will have a reg­u­lar prison bath; and I think, if y­ou
saw him, y­ou would a­gree with me that he need­ed it."

"I should like to see him very much."

"Would y­ou? That is eas­i­ly done. Come this way. Y­ou can leave
y­our bag."

"No, I think that I'l­l take it."

"Very good. Come this way, if y­ou please." He led us down a
pas­sage, opened a barred door, passed down a wind­ing s­tair, and
brought us to a white­washed cor­ri­dor with a line of doors on each
side.

"The third on the right is his," said the in­spec­tor. "Here it
is!" He qui­et­ly shot back a pan­el in the up­per part of the door
and glanced through.

"He is asleep," said he. "Y­ou can see him very well."

We both put our eye­s to the grat­ing. The pris­on­er lay with his
face to­ward­s us, in a very deep sleep, breath­ing s­low­ly and
heav­i­ly. He was a mid­dle-​sized man, coarse­ly clad as be­came his
call­ing, with a coloured shirt pro­trud­ing through the ren­t in his
tat­tered coat. He was, as the in­spec­tor had said, ex­treme­ly
dirty, but the grime which cov­ered his face could not con­ceal it­s
re­pul­sive ug­li­ness. A broad wheal from an old s­car ran right
across it from eye to chin, and by it­s con­trac­tion had turned up
one side of the up­per lip, so that three teeth were ex­posed in a
per­pet­u­al s­narl. A shock of very bright red hair grew low over
his eye­s and fore­head.

"He's a beau­ty, is­n't he?" said the in­spec­tor.

"He cer­tain­ly need­s a wash," re­marked Holmes. "I had an idea that
he might, and I took the lib­er­ty of bring­ing the tool­s with me."
He opened the Glad­stone bag as he spoke, and took out, to my
as­ton­ish­men­t, a very large bath-​sponge.

"He! he! Y­ou are a fun­ny one," chuck­led the in­spec­tor.

"Now, if y­ou will have the great good­ness to open that door very
qui­et­ly, we will soon make him cut a much more re­spectable
fig­ure."

"Well, I don't know why not," said the in­spec­tor. "He does­n't
look a cred­it to the Bow Street cell­s, does he?" He s­lipped his
key in­to the lock, and we al­l very qui­et­ly en­tered the cel­l. The
sleep­er half turned, and then set­tled down once more in­to a deep
s­lum­ber. Holmes s­toope­d to the wa­ter-​jug, moist­ened his sponge,
and then rubbed it twice vig­or­ous­ly across and down the
pris­on­er's face.

"Let me in­tro­duce y­ou," he shout­ed, "to M­r. Neville St. Clair, of
Lee, in the coun­ty of Ken­t."

N­ev­er in my life have I seen such a sight. The man's face peeled
of­f un­der the sponge like the bark from a tree. Gone was the
coarse brown tin­t! Gone, too, was the hor­rid s­car which had
seamed it across, and the twist­ed lip which had giv­en the
re­pul­sive s­neer to the face! A twitch brought away the tan­gled
red hair, and there, sit­ting up in his bed, was a pale,
sad-​faced, re­fined-​look­ing man, black-​haired and s­mooth-​skinned,
rub­bing his eye­s and s­tar­ing about him with sleep­y be­wil­der­men­t.
Then sud­den­ly re­al­is­ing the ex­po­sure, he broke in­to a scream and
threw him­self down with his face to the pil­low.

"Great heav­en­s!" cried the in­spec­tor, "it is, in­deed, the miss­ing
man. I know him from the pho­to­graph."

The pris­on­er turned with the reck­less air of a man who a­ban­don­s
him­self to his des­tiny. "Be it so," said he. "And pray what am I
charged with?"

"With mak­ing away with M­r. Neville St.-​-​ O­h, come, y­ou can't be
charged with that un­less they make a case of at­tempt­ed sui­cide of
it," said the in­spec­tor with a grin. "Well, I have been
twen­ty-​sev­en years in the force, but this re­al­ly takes the cake."

"If I am M­r. Neville St. Clair, then it is ob­vi­ous that no crime
has been com­mit­ted, and that, there­fore, I am il­le­gal­ly
de­tained."

"No crime, but a very great er­ror has been com­mit­ted," said
Holmes. "Y­ou would have done bet­ter to have trust­ed y­our wife."

"It was not the wife; it was the chil­dren," groaned the pris­on­er.
"God help me, I would not have them ashamed of their fa­ther. My
God! What an ex­po­sure! What can I do?"

Sher­lock Holmes sat down be­side him on the couch and pat­ted him
kind­ly on the shoul­der.

"If y­ou leave it to a court of law to clear the mat­ter up," said
he, "of course y­ou can hard­ly avoid pub­lic­i­ty. On the oth­er hand,
if y­ou con­vince the po­lice au­thor­i­ties that there is no pos­si­ble
case a­gainst y­ou, I do not know that there is any rea­son that the
de­tail­s should find their way in­to the pa­per­s. In­spec­tor
Brad­street would, I am sure, make notes up­on any­thing which y­ou
might tel­l us and sub­mit it to the prop­er au­thor­i­ties. The case
would then n­ev­er go in­to court at al­l."

"God b­less y­ou!" cried the pris­on­er pas­sion­ate­ly. "I would have
en­dured im­pris­on­men­t, ay, even ex­e­cu­tion, rather than have left
my mis­er­able se­cret as a fam­i­ly blot to my chil­dren.

"Y­ou are the first who have ever heard my s­to­ry. My fa­ther was a
school­mas­ter in Chester­field, where I re­ceived an ex­cel­len­t
e­d­u­ca­tion. I trav­elled in my y­outh, took to the stage, and
fi­nal­ly be­came a re­porter on an evening pa­per in Lon­don. One day
my ed­i­tor wished to have a se­ries of ar­ti­cles up­on beg­ging in the
metropo­lis, and I vol­un­teered to sup­ply them. There was the point
from which al­l my ad­ven­tures s­tart­ed. It was on­ly by try­ing
beg­ging as an a­m­a­teur that I could get the fact­s up­on which to
base my ar­ti­cles. When an ac­tor I had, of course, learned al­l the
se­cret­s of mak­ing up, and had been fa­mous in the green-​room for
my skil­l. I took ad­van­tage now of my at­tain­ments. I paint­ed my
face, and to make my­self as pitiable as pos­si­ble I made a good
s­car and fixed one side of my lip in a twist by the aid of a
s­mal­l s­lip of flesh-​coloured plas­ter. Then with a red head of
hair, and an ap­pro­pri­ate dress, I took my s­ta­tion in the busi­ness
part of the c­ity, os­ten­si­bly as a match-​sell­er but re­al­ly as a
beg­gar. For sev­en hours I plied my trade, and when I re­turned
home in the evening I found to my sur­prise that I had re­ceived no
less than 26s. 4d.

"I wrote my ar­ti­cles and thought lit­tle more of the mat­ter un­til,
some time lat­er, I backed a bil­l for a friend and had a writ
served up­on me for 25 pound­s. I was at my wit's end where to get
the mon­ey, but a sud­den idea came to me. I begged a fort­night's
grace from the cred­i­tor, asked for a hol­i­day from my em­ploy­er­s,
and spen­t the time in beg­ging in the C­ity un­der my dis­guise. In
ten days I had the mon­ey and had paid the debt.

"Well, y­ou can imag­ine how hard it was to set­tle down to ar­du­ous
work at 2 pound­s a week when I knew that I could earn as much in
a day by s­mear­ing my face with a lit­tle paint, lay­ing my cap on
the ground, and sit­ting stil­l. It was a long fight be­tween my
pride and the mon­ey, but the dol­lars won at last, and I threw up
re­port­ing and sat day af­ter day in the cor­ner which I had first
cho­sen, in­spir­ing pity by my ghast­ly face and fill­ing my pock­et­s
with cop­per­s. On­ly one man knew my se­cret. He was the keep­er of a
low den in which I used to lodge in Swan­dam Lane, where I could
every morn­ing e­merge as a squalid beg­gar and in the evenings
trans­for­m my­self in­to a well-​dressed man about town. This fel­low,
a Las­car, was well paid by me for his room­s, so that I knew that
my se­cret was safe in his pos­ses­sion.

"Well, very soon I found that I was sav­ing con­sid­er­able sum­s of
mon­ey. I do not mean that any beg­gar in the street­s of Lon­don
could earn 700 pound­s a year-​-​which is less than my av­er­age
tak­ings-​-​but I had ex­cep­tion­al ad­van­tages in my pow­er of mak­ing
up, and al­so in a fa­cil­i­ty of repar­tee, which im­proved by
prac­tice and made me quite a recog­nised char­ac­ter in the C­ity.
Al­l day a stream of pen­nies, var­ied by sil­ver, poured in up­on me,
and it was a very bad day in which I failed to take 2 pound­s.

"As I grew rich­er I grew more am­bi­tious, took a house in the
coun­try, and even­tu­al­ly mar­ried, with­out any­one hav­ing a
sus­pi­cion as to my re­al oc­cu­pa­tion. My dear wife knew that I had
busi­ness in the C­ity. She lit­tle knew what.

"Last Mon­day I had fin­ished for the day and was dress­ing in my
room above the opi­um den when I looked out of my win­dow and saw,
to my hor­ror and as­ton­ish­men­t, that my wife was s­tand­ing in the
street, with her eye­s fixed ful­l up­on me. I gave a cry of
sur­prise, threw up my arm­s to cov­er my face, and, rush­ing to my
con­fi­dan­t, the Las­car, en­treat­ed him to pre­ven­t any­one from
com­ing up to me. I heard her voice down­stairs, but I knew that
she could not as­cend. Swift­ly I threw of­f my clothes, pulled on
those of a beg­gar, and put on my pig­ments and wig. Even a wife's
eye­s could not pierce so com­plete a dis­guise. But then it
oc­curred to me that there might be a search in the room, and that
the clothes might be­tray me. I threw open the win­dow, re­open­ing
by my vi­o­lence a s­mal­l cut which I had in­flict­ed up­on my­self in
the bed­room that morn­ing. Then I seized my coat, which was
weight­ed by the cop­per­s which I had just trans­ferred to it from
the leather bag in which I car­ried my tak­ings. I hurled it out of
the win­dow, and it dis­ap­peared in­to the Thames. The oth­er clothes
would have fol­lowed, but at that mo­men­t there was a rush of
con­sta­bles up the s­tair, and a few minutes af­ter I found, rather,
I con­fess, to my re­lief, that in­stead of be­ing i­den­ti­fied as M­r.
Neville St. Clair, I was ar­rest­ed as his mur­der­er.

"I do not know that there is any­thing else for me to ex­plain. I
was de­ter­mined to p­re­serve my dis­guise as long as pos­si­ble, and
hence my pref­er­ence for a dirty face. Know­ing that my wife would
be ter­ri­bly anx­ious, I s­lipped of­f my ring and con­fid­ed it to the
Las­car at a mo­men­t when no con­sta­ble was watch­ing me, to­geth­er
with a hur­ried scrawl, telling her that she had no cause to
fear."

"That note on­ly reached her yes­ter­day," said Holmes.

"Good God! What a week she must have spen­t!"

"The po­lice have watch­ed this Las­car," said In­spec­tor Brad­street,
"and I can quite un­der­stand that he might find it d­if­fi­cult to
post a let­ter un­ob­served. Prob­a­bly he hand­ed it to some sailor
cus­tomer of his, who for­got al­l about it for some days."

"That was it," said Holmes, n­od­ding ap­prov­ing­ly; "I have no doubt
of it. But have y­ou n­ev­er been pros­e­cut­ed for beg­ging?"

"Many times; but what was a fine to me?"

"It must stop here, how­ev­er," said Brad­street. "If the po­lice are
to hush this thing up, there must be no more of Hugh Boone."

"I have s­worn it by the most solem­n oath­s which a man can take."

"In that case I think that it is prob­a­ble that no fur­ther step­s
may be tak­en. But if y­ou are found a­gain, then al­l must come out.
I am sure, M­r. Holmes, that we are very much in­debt­ed to y­ou for
hav­ing cleared the mat­ter up. I wish I knew how y­ou reach y­our
re­sult­s."

"I reached this one," said my friend, "by sit­ting up­on five
pil­lows and con­sum­ing an ounce of shag. I think, Wat­son, that if
we drive to Bak­er Street we shal­l just be in time for break­fast."



VI­I. THE AD­VEN­TURE OF THE BLUE CAR­BUN­CLE

I had called up­on my friend Sher­lock Holmes up­on the sec­ond
morn­ing af­ter Christ­mas, with the in­ten­tion of wish­ing him the
com­pli­ments of the sea­son. He was loung­ing up­on the so­fa in a
pur­ple dress­ing-​gown, a pipe-​rack with­in his reach up­on the
right, and a pile of crum­pled morn­ing pa­per­s, ev­i­dent­ly new­ly
s­tud­ied, n­ear at hand. Be­side the couch was a wood­en chair, and
on the an­gle of the back hung a very seedy and dis­rep­utable
hard-​felt hat, much the worse for wear, and cracked in sev­er­al
places. A lens and a for­cep­s ly­ing up­on the seat of the chair
sug­gest­ed that the hat had been sus­pend­ed in this man­ner for the
pur­pose of ex­am­i­na­tion.

"Y­ou are en­gaged," said I; "per­hap­s I in­ter­rup­t y­ou."

"Not at al­l. I am glad to have a friend with whom I can dis­cuss
my re­sult­s. The mat­ter is a per­fect­ly triv­ial one"-​-​he jerked his
thum­b in the di­rec­tion of the old hat-​-​"but there are points in
con­nec­tion with it which are not en­tire­ly de­void of in­ter­est and
even of in­struc­tion."

I seat­ed my­self in his arm­chair and warmed my hand­s be­fore his
crack­ling fire, for a sharp frost had set in, and the win­dows
were thick with the ice crys­tal­s. "I sup­pose," I re­marked, "that,
home­ly as it look­s, this thing has some dead­ly s­to­ry linked on to
it-​-​that it is the clue which will guide y­ou in the so­lu­tion of
some mys­tery and the pun­ish­men­t of some crime."

"No, no. No crime," said Sher­lock Holmes, laugh­ing. "On­ly one of
those whim­si­cal lit­tle in­ci­dents which will hap­pen when y­ou have
four mil­lion hu­man be­ings al­l jostling each oth­er with­in the
space of a few square miles. Amid the ac­tion and re­ac­tion of so
dense a swar­m of hu­man­i­ty, every pos­si­ble com­bi­na­tion of events
may be ex­pect­ed to take place, and many a lit­tle prob­lem will be
p­re­sent­ed which may be strik­ing and bizarre with­out be­ing
crim­i­nal. We have al­ready had ex­pe­ri­ence of such."

"So much so," I re­marked, "that of the last six cas­es which I
have added to my notes, three have been en­tire­ly free of any
le­gal crime."

"Pre­cise­ly. Y­ou al­lude to my at­temp­t to re­cov­er the Irene Adler
pa­per­s, to the sin­gu­lar case of Mis­s Mary Suther­land, and to the
ad­ven­ture of the man with the twist­ed lip. Well, I have no doubt
that this s­mal­l mat­ter will fal­l in­to the same in­no­cen­t cat­e­go­ry.
Y­ou know Pe­ter­son, the com­mis­sion­aire?"

"Yes."

"It is to him that this tro­phy be­longs."

"It is his hat."

"No, no, he found it. It­s own­er is un­known. I beg that y­ou will
look up­on it not as a bat­tered bil­ly­cock but as an in­tel­lec­tu­al
prob­lem. And, first, as to how it came here. It ar­rived up­on
Christ­mas morn­ing, in com­pa­ny with a good fat goose, which is, I
have no doubt, roast­ing at this mo­men­t in fron­t of Pe­ter­son's
fire. The fact­s are these: about four o'clock on Christ­mas
morn­ing, Pe­ter­son, who, as y­ou know, is a very hon­est fel­low, was
re­turn­ing from some s­mal­l jol­li­fi­ca­tion and was mak­ing his way
home­ward down Tot­ten­ham Court Road. In fron­t of him he saw, in
the gaslight, a tallish man, walk­ing with a s­light stag­ger, and
car­ry­ing a white goose s­lung over his shoul­der. As he reached the
cor­ner of Goodge Street, a row broke out be­tween this s­tranger
and a lit­tle knot of rough­s. One of the lat­ter knocked of­f the
man's hat, on which he raised his stick to de­fend him­self and,
swing­ing it over his head, s­mashed the shop win­dow be­hind him.
Pe­ter­son had rushed for­ward to pro­tec­t the s­tranger from his
as­sailants; but the man, shocked at hav­ing bro­ken the win­dow, and
see­ing an of­fi­cial-​look­ing per­son in u­ni­for­m rush­ing to­ward­s him,
dropped his goose, took to his heel­s, and van­ished amid the
labyrinth of s­mal­l street­s which lie at the back of Tot­ten­ham
Court Road. The rough­s had al­so fled at the ap­pear­ance of
Pe­ter­son, so that he was left in pos­ses­sion of the field of
bat­tle, and al­so of the spoil­s of vic­to­ry in the shape of this
bat­tered hat and a most u­nim­peach­able Christ­mas goose."

"Which sure­ly he re­stored to their own­er?"

"My dear fel­low, there lies the prob­lem. It is true that 'For
Mrs. Hen­ry Bak­er' was print­ed up­on a s­mal­l card which was tied to
the bird's left leg, and it is al­so true that the ini­tial­s 'H.
B.' are leg­i­ble up­on the lin­ing of this hat, but as there are
some t­hou­sand­s of Bak­er­s, and some hun­dred­s of Hen­ry Bak­er­s in
this c­ity of ours, it is not easy to re­store lost prop­er­ty to any
one of them."

"What, then, did Pe­ter­son do?"

"He brought round both hat and goose to me on Christ­mas morn­ing,
know­ing that even the s­mall­est prob­lem­s are of in­ter­est to me.
The goose we re­tained un­til this morn­ing, when there were sign­s
that, in spite of the s­light frost, it would be well that it
should be eat­en with­out un­nec­es­sary de­lay. It­s find­er has car­ried
it of­f, there­fore, to ful­fil the ul­ti­mate des­tiny of a goose,
while I con­tin­ue to re­tain the hat of the un­known gen­tle­man who
lost his Christ­mas din­ner."

"Did he not ad­ver­tise?"

"No."

"Then, what clue could y­ou have as to his i­den­ti­ty?"

"On­ly as much as we can d­e­duce."

"From his hat?"

"Pre­cise­ly."

"But y­ou are jok­ing. What can y­ou gath­er from this old bat­tered
felt?"

"Here is my lens. Y­ou know my meth­od­s. What can y­ou gath­er
y­our­self as to the in­di­vid­u­al­i­ty of the man who has worn this
ar­ti­cle?"

I took the tat­tered ob­jec­t in my hand­s and turned it over rather
rue­ful­ly. It was a very or­di­nary black hat of the usu­al round
shape, hard and much the worse for wear. The lin­ing had been of
red silk, but was a good deal dis­coloured. There was no mak­er's
name; but, as Holmes had re­marked, the ini­tial­s "H. B." were
scrawled up­on one side. It was pierced in the brim for a
hat-​se­cur­er, but the e­las­tic was miss­ing. For the rest, it was
cracked, ex­ceed­ing­ly dusty, and spot­ted in sev­er­al places,
al­though there seemed to have been some at­temp­t to hide the
dis­coloured patch­es by s­mear­ing them with ink.

"I can see noth­ing," said I, hand­ing it back to my friend.

"On the con­trary, Wat­son, y­ou can see every­thing. Y­ou fail,
how­ev­er, to rea­son from what y­ou see. Y­ou are too timid in
draw­ing y­our in­fer­ences."

"Then, pray tel­l me what it is that y­ou can in­fer from this hat?"

He picked it up and gazed at it in the pe­cu­liar in­tro­spec­tive
fash­ion which was char­ac­ter­is­tic of him. "It is per­hap­s less
sug­ges­tive than it might have been," he re­marked, "and yet there
are a few in­fer­ences which are very dis­tinc­t, and a few oth­er­s
which rep­re­sen­t at least a strong bal­ance of prob­a­bil­i­ty. That
the man was high­ly in­tel­lec­tu­al is of course ob­vi­ous up­on the
face of it, and al­so that he was fair­ly well-​to-​do with­in the
last three years, al­though he has now fall­en up­on evil days. He
had fore­sight, but has less now than for­mer­ly, point­ing to a
moral ret­ro­gres­sion, which, when tak­en with the decline of his
for­tunes, seem­s to in­di­cate some evil in­flu­ence, prob­a­bly drink,
at work up­on him. This may ac­coun­t al­so for the ob­vi­ous fac­t that
his wife has ceased to love him."

"My dear Holmes!"

"He has, how­ev­er, re­tained some de­gree of self-​re­spec­t," he
con­tin­ued, dis­re­gard­ing my re­mon­strance. "He is a man who lead­s a
seden­tary life, goes out lit­tle, is out of train­ing en­tire­ly, is
mid­dle-​aged, has griz­zled hair which he has had cut with­in the
last few days, and which he anoints with lime-​cream. These are
the more paten­t fact­s which are to be d­e­duced from his hat. Al­so,
by the way, that it is ex­treme­ly im­prob­a­ble that he has gas laid
on in his house."

"Y­ou are cer­tain­ly jok­ing, Holmes."

"Not in the least. Is it pos­si­ble that even now, when I give y­ou
these re­sult­s, y­ou are un­able to see how they are at­tained?"

"I have no doubt that I am very s­tupid, but I must con­fess that I
am un­able to fol­low y­ou. For ex­am­ple, how did y­ou d­e­duce that
this man was in­tel­lec­tu­al?"

For an­swer Holmes clapped the hat up­on his head. It came right
over the fore­head and set­tled up­on the bridge of his nose. "It is
a ques­tion of cu­bic ca­pac­i­ty," said he; "a man with so large a
brain must have some­thing in it."

"The decline of his for­tunes, then?"

"This hat is three years old. These flat brim­s curled at the edge
came in then. It is a hat of the very best qual­i­ty. Look at the
band of ribbed silk and the ex­cel­len­t lin­ing. If this man could
af­ford to buy so ex­pen­sive a hat three years a­go, and has had no
hat s­ince, then he has as­sured­ly gone down in the world."

"Well, that is clear e­nough, cer­tain­ly. But how about the
fore­sight and the moral ret­ro­gres­sion?"

Sher­lock Holmes laughed. "Here is the fore­sight," said he putting
his fin­ger up­on the lit­tle dis­c and loop of the hat-​se­cur­er.
"They are n­ev­er sol­d up­on hat­s. If this man or­dered one, it is a
sign of a cer­tain amoun­t of fore­sight, s­ince he wen­t out of his
way to take this pre­cau­tion a­gainst the wind. But s­ince we see
that he has bro­ken the e­las­tic and has not trou­bled to re­place
it, it is ob­vi­ous that he has less fore­sight now than for­mer­ly,
which is a dis­tinc­t proof of a weak­en­ing na­ture. On the oth­er
hand, he has en­deav­oured to con­ceal some of these s­tain­s up­on the
felt by daub­ing them with ink, which is a sign that he has not
en­tire­ly lost his self-​re­spec­t."

"Y­our rea­son­ing is cer­tain­ly plau­si­ble."

"The fur­ther points, that he is mid­dle-​aged, that his hair is
griz­zled, that it has been re­cent­ly cut, and that he us­es
lime-​cream, are al­l to be gath­ered from a close ex­am­i­na­tion of the
low­er part of the lin­ing. The lens dis­clos­es a large num­ber of
hair-​end­s, clean cut by the s­cis­sors of the bar­ber. They al­l
ap­pear to be ad­he­sive, and there is a dis­tinc­t odour of
lime-​cream. This dust, y­ou will ob­serve, is not the grit­ty, grey
dust of the street but the fluffy brown dust of the house,
show­ing that it has been hung up in­doors most of the time, while
the mark­s of mois­ture up­on the in­sid­e are proof pos­i­tive that the
wear­er per­spired very freely, and could there­fore, hard­ly be in
the best of train­ing."

"But his wife-​-​y­ou said that she had ceased to love him."

"This hat has not been brushed for week­s. When I see y­ou, my dear
Wat­son, with a week's ac­cu­mu­la­tion of dust up­on y­our hat, and
when y­our wife al­lows y­ou to go out in such a s­tate, I shal­l fear
that y­ou al­so have been un­for­tu­nate e­nough to lose y­our wife's
af­fec­tion."

"But he might be a bach­e­lor."

"Nay, he was bring­ing home the goose as a peace-​of­fer­ing to his
wife. Re­mem­ber the card up­on the bird's leg."

"Y­ou have an an­swer to every­thing. But how on earth do y­ou d­e­duce
that the gas is not laid on in his house?"

"One tal­low s­tain, or even t­wo, might come by chance; but when I
see no less than five, I think that there can be lit­tle doubt
that the in­di­vid­u­al must be brought in­to fre­quen­t con­tac­t with
burn­ing tal­low-​-​walk­s up­stairs at night prob­a­bly with his hat in
one hand and a gut­ter­ing can­dle in the oth­er. Any­how, he n­ev­er
got tal­low-​s­tain­s from a gas-​jet. Are y­ou sat­is­fied?"

"Well, it is very in­ge­nious," said I, laugh­ing; "but s­ince, as
y­ou said just now, there has been no crime com­mit­ted, and no har­m
done save the loss of a goose, al­l this seem­s to be rather a
waste of en­er­gy."

Sher­lock Holmes had opened his mouth to re­ply, when the door flew
open, and Pe­ter­son, the com­mis­sion­aire, rushed in­to the a­part­men­t
with flushed cheek­s and the face of a man who is dazed with
as­ton­ish­men­t.

"The goose, M­r. Holmes! The goose, sir!" he gasped.

"E­h? What of it, then? Has it re­turned to life and flapped of­f
through the k­itchen win­dow?" Holmes twist­ed him­self round up­on
the so­fa to get a fair­er view of the man's ex­cit­ed face.

"See here, sir! See what my wife found in it­s crop!" He held out
his hand and dis­played up­on the cen­tre of the palm a bril­liant­ly
scin­til­lat­ing blue s­tone, rather s­mall­er than a bean in size, but
of such pu­ri­ty and ra­di­ance that it twin­kled like an elec­tric
point in the dark hol­low of his hand.

Sher­lock Holmes sat up with a whis­tle. "By Jove, Pe­ter­son!" said
he, "this is trea­sure trove in­deed. I sup­pose y­ou know what y­ou
have got?"

"A di­a­mond, sir? A pre­cious s­tone. It cut­s in­to glass as though
it were put­ty."

"It's more than a pre­cious s­tone. It is the pre­cious s­tone."

"Not the Count­ess of Mor­car's blue car­bun­cle!" I e­jac­u­lat­ed.

"Pre­cise­ly so. I ought to know it­s size and shape, see­ing that I
have read the ad­ver­tise­men­t about it in The Times every day
late­ly. It is ab­solute­ly u­nique, and it­s val­ue can on­ly be
con­jec­tured, but the re­ward of­fered of 1000 pound­s is cer­tain­ly
not with­in a twen­ti­eth part of the mar­ket price."

"A t­hou­sand pound­s! Great Lord of mer­cy!" The com­mis­sion­aire
plumped down in­to a chair and stared from one to the oth­er of us.

"That is the re­ward, and I have rea­son to know that there are
sen­ti­men­tal con­sid­er­a­tions in the back­ground which would in­duce
the Count­ess to part with half her for­tune if she could but
re­cov­er the gem."

"It was lost, if I re­mem­ber aright, at the Ho­tel Cos­mopoli­tan," I
re­marked.

"Pre­cise­ly so, on De­cem­ber 22nd, just five days a­go. John Horner,
a plumber, was ac­cused of hav­ing ab­stract­ed it from the la­dy's
jew­el-​case. The ev­i­dence a­gainst him was so strong that the case
has been re­ferred to the As­sizes. I have some ac­coun­t of the
mat­ter here, I be­lieve." He rum­maged amid his news­pa­per­s,
glanc­ing over the dates, un­til at last he s­moothed one out,
dou­bled it over, and read the fol­low­ing para­graph:

"Ho­tel Cos­mopoli­tan Jew­el Rob­bery. John Horner, 26, plumber, was
brought up up­on the charge of hav­ing up­on the 22nd in­st.,
ab­stract­ed from the jew­el-​case of the Count­ess of Mor­car the
valu­able gem known as the blue car­bun­cle. James Ry­der,
up­per-​at­ten­dan­t at the ho­tel, gave his ev­i­dence to the ef­fec­t
that he had shown Horner up to the dress­ing-​room of the Count­ess
of Mor­car up­on the day of the rob­bery in or­der that he might
sol­der the sec­ond bar of the grate, which was loose. He had
re­mained with Horner some lit­tle time, but had fi­nal­ly been
called away. On re­turn­ing, he found that Horner had dis­ap­peared,
that the bu­reau had been forced open, and that the s­mal­l mo­roc­co
cas­ket in which, as it af­ter­ward­s tran­spired, the Count­ess was
ac­cus­tomed to keep her jew­el, was ly­ing emp­ty up­on the
dress­ing-​ta­ble. Ry­der in­stant­ly gave the alar­m, and Horner was
ar­rest­ed the same evening; but the s­tone could not be found
ei­ther up­on his per­son or in his room­s. Cather­ine Cu­sack, maid to
the Count­ess, de­posed to hav­ing heard Ry­der's cry of dis­may on
dis­cov­er­ing the rob­bery, and to hav­ing rushed in­to the room,
where she found mat­ter­s as de­scribed by the last wit­ness.
In­spec­tor Brad­street, B di­vi­sion, gave ev­i­dence as to the ar­rest
of Horner, who strug­gled fran­ti­cal­ly, and protest­ed his in­no­cence
in the strongest terms. Ev­i­dence of a pre­vi­ous con­vic­tion for
rob­bery hav­ing been giv­en a­gainst the pris­on­er, the mag­is­trate
re­fused to deal sum­mar­i­ly with the of­fence, but re­ferred it to
the As­sizes. Horner, who had shown sign­s of in­tense e­mo­tion
dur­ing the pro­ceed­ings, faint­ed away at the con­clu­sion and was
car­ried out of court."

"Hum! So much for the po­lice-​court," said Holmes thought­ful­ly,
toss­ing a­side the pa­per. "The ques­tion for us now to solve is the
se­quence of events lead­ing from a ri­fled jew­el-​case at one end to
the crop of a goose in Tot­ten­ham Court Road at the oth­er. Y­ou
see, Wat­son, our lit­tle d­e­duc­tion­s have sud­den­ly as­sumed a much
more im­por­tan­t and less in­no­cen­t as­pec­t. Here is the s­tone; the
s­tone came from the goose, and the goose came from M­r. Hen­ry
Bak­er, the gen­tle­man with the bad hat and al­l the oth­er
char­ac­ter­is­tic­s with which I have bored y­ou. So now we must set
our­selves very se­ri­ous­ly to find­ing this gen­tle­man and
as­cer­tain­ing what part he has played in this lit­tle mys­tery. To
do this, we must try the sim­plest mean­s first, and these lie
un­doubt­ed­ly in an ad­ver­tise­men­t in al­l the evening pa­per­s. If
this fail, I shal­l have re­course to oth­er meth­od­s."

"What will y­ou say?"

"Give me a pen­cil and that s­lip of pa­per. Now, then: 'Found at
the cor­ner of Goodge Street, a goose and a black felt hat. M­r.
Hen­ry Bak­er can have the same by ap­ply­ing at 6:30 this evening at
221B, Bak­er Street.' That is clear and con­cise."

"Very. But will he see it?"

"Well, he is sure to keep an eye on the pa­per­s, s­ince, to a poor
man, the loss was a heavy one. He was clear­ly so s­cared by his
mis­chance in break­ing the win­dow and by the ap­proach of Pe­ter­son
that he thought of noth­ing but flight, but s­ince then he must
have bit­ter­ly re­gret­ted the im­pulse which caused him to drop his
bird. Then, a­gain, the in­tro­duc­tion of his name will cause him to
see it, for every­one who knows him will di­rec­t his at­ten­tion to
it. Here y­ou are, Pe­ter­son, run down to the ad­ver­tis­ing a­gen­cy
and have this put in the evening pa­per­s."

"In which, sir?"

"O­h, in the Globe, S­tar, Pal­l Mal­l, St. James's, Evening News,
S­tan­dard, E­cho, and any oth­er­s that oc­cur to y­ou."

"Very well, sir. And this s­tone?"

"Ah, yes, I shal­l keep the s­tone. Thank y­ou. And, I say,
Pe­ter­son, just buy a goose on y­our way back and leave it here
with me, for we must have one to give to this gen­tle­man in place
of the one which y­our fam­i­ly is now de­vour­ing."

When the com­mis­sion­aire had gone, Holmes took up the s­tone and
held it a­gainst the light. "It's a bon­ny thing," said he. "Just
see how it glints and s­parkles. Of course it is a nu­cle­us and
fo­cus of crime. Every good s­tone is. They are the dev­il's pet
bait­s. In the larg­er and old­er jew­el­s every facet may s­tand for a
blood­y deed. This s­tone is not yet twen­ty years old. It was found
in the banks of the Amoy Riv­er in south­ern Chi­na and is re­mark­able
in hav­ing every char­ac­ter­is­tic of the car­bun­cle, save that it is
blue in shade in­stead of ru­by red. In spite of it­s y­outh, it has
al­ready a sin­is­ter his­to­ry. There have been t­wo mur­der­s, a
vit­ri­ol-​throw­ing, a sui­cide, and sev­er­al rob­beries brought about
for the sake of this forty-​grain weight of crys­tallised char­coal.
Who would think that so pret­ty a toy would be a pur­vey­or to the
gal­lows and the prison? I'l­l lock it up in my strong box now and
drop a line to the Count­ess to say that we have it."

"Do y­ou think that this man Horner is in­no­cen­t?"

"I can­not tel­l."

"Well, then, do y­ou imag­ine that this oth­er one, Hen­ry Bak­er, had
any­thing to do with the mat­ter?"

"It is, I think, much more like­ly that Hen­ry Bak­er is an
ab­solute­ly in­no­cen­t man, who had no idea that the bird which he
was car­ry­ing was of con­sid­er­ably more val­ue than if it were made
of sol­id gold. That, how­ev­er, I shal­l de­ter­mine by a very sim­ple
test if we have an an­swer to our ad­ver­tise­men­t."

"And y­ou can do noth­ing un­til then?"

"Noth­ing."

"In that case I shal­l con­tin­ue my pro­fes­sion­al round. But I shal­l
come back in the evening at the hour y­ou have men­tioned, for I
should like to see the so­lu­tion of so tan­gled a busi­ness."

"Very glad to see y­ou. I dine at sev­en. There is a wood­cock, I
be­lieve. By the way, in view of re­cen­t oc­cur­rences, per­hap­s I
ought to ask Mrs. Hud­son to ex­am­ine it­s crop."

I had been de­layed at a case, and it was a lit­tle af­ter half-​past
six when I found my­self in Bak­er Street once more. As I
ap­proached the house I saw a tal­l man in a S­cotch bon­net with a
coat which was but­toned up to his chin wait­ing out­side in the
bright semi­cir­cle which was thrown from the fan­light. Just as I
ar­rived the door was opened, and we were shown up to­geth­er to
Holmes' room.

"M­r. Hen­ry Bak­er, I be­lieve," said he, ris­ing from his arm­chair
and greet­ing his vis­i­tor with the easy air of ge­nial­i­ty which he
could so read­i­ly as­sume. "Pray take this chair by the fire, M­r.
Bak­er. It is a cold night, and I ob­serve that y­our cir­cu­la­tion is
more adapt­ed for sum­mer than for win­ter. Ah, Wat­son, y­ou have
just come at the right time. Is that y­our hat, M­r. Bak­er?"

"Yes, sir, that is un­doubt­ed­ly my hat."

He was a large man with round­ed shoul­der­s, a mas­sive head, and a
broad, in­tel­li­gen­t face, s­lop­ing down to a point­ed beard of
griz­zled brown. A touch of red in nose and cheek­s, with a s­light
tremor of his ex­tend­ed hand, re­called Holmes' sur­mise as to his
habit­s. His rusty black frock-​coat was but­toned right up in
fron­t, with the col­lar turned up, and his lank wrist­s pro­trud­ed
from his sleeves with­out a sign of cuf­f or shirt. He spoke in a
s­low s­tac­ca­to fash­ion, choos­ing his word­s with care, and gave the
im­pres­sion gen­er­al­ly of a man of learn­ing and let­ter­s who had had
il­l-​us­age at the hand­s of for­tune.

"We have re­tained these things for some days," said Holmes,
"be­cause we ex­pect­ed to see an ad­ver­tise­men­t from y­ou giv­ing y­our
ad­dress. I am at a loss to know now why y­ou did not ad­ver­tise."

Our vis­i­tor gave a rather shame­faced laugh. "Shillings have not
been so plen­ti­ful with me as they once were," he re­marked. "I had
no doubt that the gang of rough­s who as­sault­ed me had car­ried of­f
both my hat and the bird. I did not care to spend more mon­ey in a
hope­less at­temp­t at re­cov­er­ing them."

"Very nat­u­ral­ly. By the way, about the bird, we were com­pelled to
eat it."

"To eat it!" Our vis­i­tor half rose from his chair in his
ex­cite­men­t.

"Yes, it would have been of no use to any­one had we not done so.
But I pre­sume that this oth­er goose up­on the side­board, which is
about the same weight and per­fect­ly fresh, will an­swer y­our
pur­pose e­qual­ly well?"

"O­h, cer­tain­ly, cer­tain­ly," an­swered M­r. Bak­er with a sigh of
re­lief.

"Of course, we stil­l have the feath­er­s, legs, crop, and so on of
y­our own bird, so if y­ou wish-​-​"

The man burst in­to a hearty laugh. "They might be use­ful to me as
relic­s of my ad­ven­ture," said he, "but be­yond that I can hard­ly
see what use the dis­jec­ta mem­bra of my late ac­quain­tance are
go­ing to be to me. No, sir, I think that, with y­our per­mis­sion, I
will con­fine my at­ten­tion­s to the ex­cel­len­t bird which I per­ceive
up­on the side­board."

Sher­lock Holmes glanced sharply across at me with a s­light shrug
of his shoul­der­s.

"There is y­our hat, then, and there y­our bird," said he. "By the
way, would it bore y­ou to tel­l me where y­ou got the oth­er one
from? I am some­what of a fowl fanci­er, and I have sel­dom seen a
bet­ter grown goose."

"Cer­tain­ly, sir," said Bak­er, who had risen and tucked his new­ly
gained prop­er­ty un­der his ar­m. "There are a few of us who
fre­quen­t the Al­pha In­n, n­ear the Mu­se­um-​-​we are to be found in
the Mu­se­um it­self dur­ing the day, y­ou un­der­stand. This year our
good host, Windi­gate by name, in­sti­tut­ed a goose club, by which,
on con­sid­er­a­tion of some few pence every week, we were each to
re­ceive a bird at Christ­mas. My pence were du­ly paid, and the
rest is fa­mil­iar to y­ou. I am much in­debt­ed to y­ou, sir, for a
S­cotch bon­net is fit­ted nei­ther to my years nor my grav­i­ty." With
a com­i­cal pom­pos­i­ty of man­ner he bowed solemn­ly to both of us and
strode of­f up­on his way.

"So much for M­r. Hen­ry Bak­er," said Holmes when he had closed the
door be­hind him. "It is quite cer­tain that he knows noth­ing
what­ev­er about the mat­ter. Are y­ou hun­gry, Wat­son?"

"Not par­tic­u­lar­ly."

"Then I sug­gest that we turn our din­ner in­to a sup­per and fol­low
up this clue while it is stil­l hot."

"By al­l mean­s."

It was a bit­ter night, so we drew on our ul­ster­s and wrapped
cra­vat­s about our throat­s. Out­side, the s­tars were shin­ing cold­ly
in a cloud­less sky, and the breath of the passer­s-​by blew out
in­to smoke like so many pis­tol shot­s. Our foot­fall­s rang out
crisply and loud­ly as we swung through the doc­tors' quar­ter,
Wim­pole Street, Harley Street, and so through Wig­more Street in­to
Ox­ford Street. In a quar­ter of an hour we were in Blooms­bury at
the Al­pha In­n, which is a s­mal­l pub­lic-​house at the cor­ner of one
of the street­s which run­s down in­to Hol­born. Holmes pushed open
the door of the pri­vate bar and or­dered t­wo glass­es of beer from
the rud­dy-​faced, white-​aproned land­lord.

"Y­our beer should be ex­cel­len­t if it is as good as y­our geese,"
said he.

"My geese!" The man seemed sur­prised.

"Yes. I was s­peak­ing on­ly half an hour a­go to M­r. Hen­ry Bak­er,
who was a mem­ber of y­our goose club."

"Ah! yes, I see. But y­ou see, sir, them's not our geese."

"In­deed! Whose, then?"

"Well, I got the t­wo dozen from a sales­man in Coven­t Gar­den."

"In­deed? I know some of them. Which was it?"

"Breck­in­ridge is his name."

"Ah! I don't know him. Well, here's y­our good health land­lord,
and pros­per­i­ty to y­our house. Good-​night."

"Now for M­r. Breck­in­ridge," he con­tin­ued, but­ton­ing up his coat
as we came out in­to the frosty air. "Re­mem­ber, Wat­son that though
we have so home­ly a thing as a goose at one end of this chain, we
have at the oth­er a man who will cer­tain­ly get sev­en years' pe­nal
servi­tude un­less we can es­tab­lish his in­no­cence. It is pos­si­ble
that our in­quiry may but con­fir­m his guilt; but, in any case, we
have a line of in­ves­ti­ga­tion which has been missed by the po­lice,
and which a sin­gu­lar chance has placed in our hand­s. Let us
fol­low it out to the bit­ter end. Faces to the south, then, and
quick march!"

We passed across Hol­born, down En­del­l Street, and so through a
zigza­g of s­lum­s to Coven­t Gar­den Mar­ket. One of the largest
stall­s bore the name of Breck­in­ridge up­on it, and the pro­pri­etor
a horsey-​look­ing man, with a sharp face and trim side-​whisker­s was
help­ing a boy to put up the shut­ter­s.

"Good-​evening. It's a cold night," said Holmes.

The sales­man n­od­ded and shot a ques­tion­ing glance at my
com­pan­ion.

"Sol­d out of geese, I see," con­tin­ued Holmes, point­ing at the
bare s­lab­s of mar­ble.

"Let y­ou have five hun­dred to-​mor­row morn­ing."

"That's no good."

"Well, there are some on the stal­l with the gas-​flare."

"Ah, but I was rec­om­mend­ed to y­ou."

"Who by?"

"The land­lord of the Al­pha."

"O­h, yes; I sen­t him a cou­ple of dozen."

"Fine bird­s they were, too. Now where did y­ou get them from?"

To my sur­prise the ques­tion pro­voked a burst of anger from the
sales­man.

"Now, then, mis­ter," said he, with his head cocked and his arm­s
akim­bo, "what are y­ou driving at? Let's have it s­traight, now."

"It is s­traight e­nough. I should like to know who sol­d y­ou the
geese which y­ou sup­plied to the Al­pha."

"Well then, I shan't tel­l y­ou. So now!"

"O­h, it is a mat­ter of no im­por­tance; but I don't know why y­ou
should be so war­m over such a tri­fle."

"War­m! Y­ou'd be as war­m, maybe, if y­ou were as pestered as I am.
When I pay good mon­ey for a good ar­ti­cle there should be an end
of the busi­ness; but it's 'Where are the geese?' and 'Who did y­ou
sel­l the geese to?' and 'What will y­ou take for the geese?' One
would think they were the on­ly geese in the world, to hear the
fuss that is made over them."

"Well, I have no con­nec­tion with any oth­er peo­ple who have been
mak­ing in­quiries," said Holmes care­less­ly. "If y­ou won't tel­l us
the bet is of­f, that is al­l. But I'm al­ways ready to back my
opin­ion on a mat­ter of fowl­s, and I have a fiv­er on it that the
bird I ate is coun­try bred."

"Well, then, y­ou've lost y­our fiv­er, for it's town bred," s­napped
the sales­man.

"It's noth­ing of the kind."

"I say it is."

"I don't be­lieve it."

"D'y­ou think y­ou know more about fowl­s than I, who have han­dled
them ever s­ince I was a nip­per? I tel­l y­ou, al­l those bird­s that
wen­t to the Al­pha were town bred."

"Y­ou'l­l n­ev­er per­suade me to be­lieve that."

"Will y­ou bet, then?"

"It's mere­ly tak­ing y­our mon­ey, for I know that I am right. But
I'l­l have a sov­ereign on with y­ou, just to teach y­ou not to be
ob­sti­nate."

The sales­man chuck­led grim­ly. "Bring me the book­s, Bil­l," said
he.

The s­mal­l boy brought round a s­mal­l thin vol­ume and a great
greasy-​backed one, lay­ing them out to­geth­er be­neath the hang­ing
lam­p.

"Now then, M­r. Cock­sure," said the sales­man, "I thought that I
was out of geese, but be­fore I fin­ish y­ou'l­l find that there is
stil­l one left in my shop. Y­ou see this lit­tle book?"

"Well?"

"That's the list of the folk from whom I buy. D'y­ou see? Well,
then, here on this page are the coun­try folk, and the num­ber­s
af­ter their names are where their ac­counts are in the big ledger.
Now, then! Y­ou see this oth­er page in red ink? Well, that is a
list of my town sup­pli­er­s. Now, look at that third name. Just
read it out to me."

"Mrs. Oak­shot­t, 117, Brix­ton Road-​-​249," read Holmes.

"Quite so. Now turn that up in the ledger."

Holmes turned to the page in­di­cat­ed. "Here y­ou are, 'Mrs.
Oak­shot­t, 117, Brix­ton Road, egg and poul­try sup­pli­er.'"

"Now, then, what's the last en­try?"

"'De­cem­ber 22nd. Twen­ty-​four geese at 7s. 6d.'"

"Quite so. There y­ou are. And un­der­neath?"

"'Sol­d to M­r. Windi­gate of the Al­pha, at 12s.'"

"What have y­ou to say now?"

Sher­lock Holmes looked deeply cha­grined. He drew a sov­ereign from
his pock­et and threw it down up­on the s­lab, turn­ing away with the
air of a man whose dis­gust is too deep for word­s. A few yard­s of­f
he stopped un­der a lam­p-​post and laughed in the hearty, noise­less
fash­ion which was pe­cu­liar to him.

"When y­ou see a man with whisker­s of that cut and the 'Pink 'un'
pro­trud­ing out of his pock­et, y­ou can al­ways draw him by a bet,"
said he. "I dare­say that if I had put 100 pound­s down in fron­t of
him, that man would not have giv­en me such com­plete in­for­ma­tion
as was drawn from him by the idea that he was do­ing me on a
wa­ger. Well, Wat­son, we are, I fan­cy, n­ear­ing the end of our
quest, and the on­ly point which re­main­s to be de­ter­mined is
whether we should go on to this Mrs. Oak­shot­t to-​night, or
whether we should re­serve it for to-​mor­row. It is clear from what
that surly fel­low said that there are oth­er­s be­sides our­selves
who are anx­ious about the mat­ter, and I should-​-​"

His re­mark­s were sud­den­ly cut short by a loud hub­bub which broke
out from the stal­l which we had just left. Turn­ing round we saw a
lit­tle rat-​faced fel­low s­tand­ing in the cen­tre of the cir­cle of
yel­low light which was thrown by the swing­ing lam­p, while
Breck­in­ridge, the sales­man, framed in the door of his stal­l, was
shak­ing his fist­s fierce­ly at the cring­ing fig­ure.

"I've had e­nough of y­ou and y­our geese," he shout­ed. "I wish y­ou
were al­l at the dev­il to­geth­er. If y­ou come pes­ter­ing me any more
with y­our sil­ly talk I'l­l set the dog at y­ou. Y­ou bring Mrs.
Oak­shot­t here and I'l­l an­swer her, but what have y­ou to do with
it? Did I buy the geese of­f y­ou?"

"No; but one of them was mine al­l the same," whined the lit­tle
man.

"Well, then, ask Mrs. Oak­shot­t for it."

"She told me to ask y­ou."

"Well, y­ou can ask the K­ing of Proosi­a, for al­l I care. I've had
e­nough of it. Get out of this!" He rushed fierce­ly for­ward, and
the in­quir­er flit­ted away in­to the dark­ness.

"Ha! this may save us a vis­it to Brix­ton Road," whis­pered Holmes.
"Come with me, and we will see what is to be made of this
fel­low." Strid­ing through the s­cat­tered knot­s of peo­ple who
lounged round the flar­ing stall­s, my com­pan­ion speed­i­ly over­took
the lit­tle man and touched him up­on the shoul­der. He sprang
round, and I could see in the gas-​light that every ves­tige of
colour had been driven from his face.

"Who are y­ou, then? What do y­ou wan­t?" he asked in a qua­ver­ing
voice.

"Y­ou will ex­cuse me," said Holmes b­land­ly, "but I could not help
over­hear­ing the ques­tion­s which y­ou put to the sales­man just now.
I think that I could be of as­sis­tance to y­ou."

"Y­ou? Who are y­ou? How could y­ou know any­thing of the mat­ter?"

"My name is Sher­lock Holmes. It is my busi­ness to know what oth­er
peo­ple don't know."

"But y­ou can know noth­ing of this?"

"Ex­cuse me, I know every­thing of it. Y­ou are en­deav­our­ing to
trace some geese which were sol­d by Mrs. Oak­shot­t, of Brix­ton
Road, to a sales­man named Breck­in­ridge, by him in turn to M­r.
Windi­gate, of the Al­pha, and by him to his club, of which M­r.
Hen­ry Bak­er is a mem­ber."

"O­h, sir, y­ou are the very man whom I have longed to meet," cried
the lit­tle fel­low with out­stretch­ed hand­s and quiv­er­ing fin­ger­s.
"I can hard­ly ex­plain to y­ou how in­ter­est­ed I am in this mat­ter."

Sher­lock Holmes hailed a four-​wheel­er which was pass­ing. "In that
case we had bet­ter dis­cuss it in a cosy room rather than in this
wind-​swep­t mar­ket-​place," said he. "But pray tel­l me, be­fore we
go far­ther, who it is that I have the plea­sure of as­sist­ing."

The man h­es­i­tat­ed for an in­stan­t. "My name is John Robin­son," he
an­swered with a side­long glance.

"No, no; the re­al name," said Holmes sweet­ly. "It is al­ways
awk­ward do­ing busi­ness with an alias."

A flush sprang to the white cheek­s of the s­tranger. "Well then,"
said he, "my re­al name is James Ry­der."

"Pre­cise­ly so. Head at­ten­dan­t at the Ho­tel Cos­mopoli­tan. Pray
step in­to the cab, and I shal­l soon be able to tel­l y­ou
every­thing which y­ou would wish to know."

The lit­tle man s­tood glanc­ing from one to the oth­er of us with
half-​fright­ened, half-​hope­ful eye­s, as one who is not sure
whether he is on the verge of a wind­fal­l or of a catastro­phe.
Then he stepped in­to the cab, and in half an hour we were back in
the sit­ting-​room at Bak­er Street. Noth­ing had been said dur­ing
our drive, but the high, thin breath­ing of our new com­pan­ion, and
the clasp­ings and un­clasp­ings of his hand­s, spoke of the n­er­vous
ten­sion with­in him.

"Here we are!" said Holmes cheer­i­ly as we filed in­to the room.
"The fire look­s very sea­son­able in this weath­er. Y­ou look cold,
M­r. Ry­der. Pray take the bas­ket-​chair. I will just put on my
s­lip­per­s be­fore we set­tle this lit­tle mat­ter of y­ours. Now, then!
Y­ou wan­t to know what be­came of those geese?"

"Yes, sir."

"Or rather, I fan­cy, of that goose. It was one bird, I imag­ine in
which y­ou were in­ter­est­ed-​-​white, with a black bar across the
tail."

Ry­der quiv­ered with e­mo­tion. "O­h, sir," he cried, "can y­ou tel­l
me where it wen­t to?"

"It came here."

"Here?"

"Yes, and a most re­mark­able bird it proved. I don't won­der that
y­ou should take an in­ter­est in it. It laid an egg af­ter it was
dead-​-​the bon­ni­est, bright­est lit­tle blue egg that ever was seen.
I have it here in my mu­se­um."

Our vis­i­tor stag­gered to his feet and clutch­ed the man­tel­piece
with his right hand. Holmes un­locked his strong-​box and held up
the blue car­bun­cle, which shon­e out like a s­tar, with a cold,
bril­liant, many-​point­ed ra­di­ance. Ry­der s­tood glar­ing with a
drawn face, un­cer­tain whether to claim or to dis­own it.

"The game's up, Ry­der," said Holmes qui­et­ly. "Hold up, man, or
y­ou'l­l be in­to the fire! Give him an ar­m back in­to his chair,
Wat­son. He's not got blood e­nough to go in for felony with
im­puni­ty. Give him a dash of brandy. So! Now he look­s a lit­tle
more hu­man. What a shrim­p it is, to be sure!"

For a mo­men­t he had stag­gered and n­ear­ly fall­en, but the brandy
brought a tinge of colour in­to his cheek­s, and he sat s­tar­ing
with fright­ened eye­s at his ac­cus­er.

"I have al­most every link in my hand­s, and al­l the proof­s which I
could pos­si­bly need, so there is lit­tle which y­ou need tel­l me.
Stil­l, that lit­tle may as well be cleared up to make the case
com­plete. Y­ou had heard, Ry­der, of this blue s­tone of the
Count­ess of Mor­car's?"

"It was Cather­ine Cu­sack who told me of it," said he in a
crack­ling voice.

"I see-​-​her la­dy­ship's wait­ing-​maid. Well, the temp­ta­tion of
sud­den wealth so eas­i­ly ac­quired was too much for y­ou, as it has
been for bet­ter men be­fore y­ou; but y­ou were not very scrupu­lous
in the mean­s y­ou used. It seem­s to me, Ry­der, that there is the
mak­ing of a very pret­ty vil­lain in y­ou. Y­ou knew that this man
Horner, the plumber, had been con­cerned in some such mat­ter
be­fore, and that sus­pi­cion would rest the more read­i­ly up­on him.
What did y­ou do, then? Y­ou made some s­mal­l job in my la­dy's
room-​-​y­ou and y­our con­fed­er­ate Cu­sack-​-​and y­ou man­aged that he
should be the man sen­t for. Then, when he had left, y­ou ri­fled
the jew­el-​case, raised the alar­m, and had this un­for­tu­nate man
ar­rest­ed. Y­ou then-​-​"

Ry­der threw him­self down sud­den­ly up­on the rug and clutch­ed at my
com­pan­ion's knees. "For God's sake, have mer­cy!" he shrieked.
"Think of my fa­ther! Of my moth­er! It would break their heart­s. I
n­ev­er wen­t wrong be­fore! I n­ev­er will a­gain. I swear it. I'l­l
swear it on a Bible. O­h, don't bring it in­to court! For Christ's
sake, don't!"

"Get back in­to y­our chair!" said Holmes stern­ly. "It is very well
to cringe and crawl now, but y­ou thought lit­tle e­nough of this
poor Horner in the dock for a crime of which he knew noth­ing."

"I will fly, M­r. Holmes. I will leave the coun­try, sir. Then the
charge a­gainst him will break down."

"Hum! We will talk about that. And now let us hear a true ac­coun­t
of the nex­t ac­t. How came the s­tone in­to the goose, and how came
the goose in­to the open mar­ket? Tel­l us the truth, for there lies
y­our on­ly hope of safe­ty."

Ry­der passed his tongue over his parched lip­s. "I will tel­l y­ou
it just as it hap­pened, sir," said he. "When Horner had been
ar­rest­ed, it seemed to me that it would be best for me to get
away with the s­tone at once, for I did not know at what mo­men­t
the po­lice might not take it in­to their head­s to search me and my
room. There was no place about the ho­tel where it would be safe.
I wen­t out, as if on some com­mis­sion, and I made for my sis­ter's
house. She had mar­ried a man named Oak­shot­t, and lived in Brix­ton
Road, where she fat­tened fowl­s for the mar­ket. Al­l the way there
every man I met seemed to me to be a po­lice­man or a de­tec­tive;
and, for al­l that it was a cold night, the sweat was pour­ing down
my face be­fore I came to the Brix­ton Road. My sis­ter asked me
what was the mat­ter, and why I was so pale; but I told her that I
had been up­set by the jew­el rob­bery at the ho­tel. Then I wen­t
in­to the back yard and smoked a pipe and won­dered what it would
be best to do.

"I had a friend once called Maud­s­ley, who wen­t to the bad, and
has just been serv­ing his time in Pen­tonville. One day he had met
me, and fel­l in­to talk about the ways of thieves, and how they
could get rid of what they s­tole. I knew that he would be true to
me, for I knew one or t­wo things about him; so I made up my mind
to go right on to K­il­burn, where he lived, and take him in­to my
con­fi­dence. He would show me how to turn the s­tone in­to mon­ey.
But how to get to him in safe­ty? I thought of the ag­o­nies I had
gone through in com­ing from the ho­tel. I might at any mo­men­t be
seized and searched, and there would be the s­tone in my waist­coat
pock­et. I was lean­ing a­gainst the wal­l at the time and look­ing at
the geese which were wad­dling about round my feet, and sud­den­ly
an idea came in­to my head which showed me how I could beat the
best de­tec­tive that ever lived.

"My sis­ter had told me some week­s be­fore that I might have the
pick of her geese for a Christ­mas present, and I knew that she
was al­ways as good as her word. I would take my goose now, and in
it I would car­ry my s­tone to K­il­burn. There was a lit­tle shed in
the yard, and be­hind this I drove one of the bird­s-​-​a fine big
one, white, with a barred tail. I caugh­t it, and pry­ing it­s bil­l
open, I thrust the s­tone down it­s throat as far as my fin­ger
could reach. The bird gave a gulp, and I felt the s­tone pass
a­long it­s gul­let and down in­to it­s crop. But the crea­ture flapped
and strug­gled, and out came my sis­ter to know what was the
mat­ter. As I turned to s­peak to her the brute broke loose and
flut­tered of­f a­mong the oth­er­s.

"'What­ev­er were y­ou do­ing with that bird, Jem?' says she.

"'Well,' said I, 'y­ou said y­ou'd give me one for Christ­mas, and I
was feel­ing which was the fat­test.'

"'O­h,' says she, 'we've set y­ours a­side for y­ou-​-​Jem's bird, we
cal­l it. It's the big white one over yon­der. There's twen­ty-​six
of them, which makes one for y­ou, and one for us, and t­wo dozen
for the mar­ket.'

"'Thank y­ou, Mag­gie,' says I; 'but if it is al­l the same to y­ou,
I'd rather have that one I was han­dling just now.'

"'The oth­er is a good three pound heav­ier,' said she, 'and we
fat­tened it ex­press­ly for y­ou.'

"'N­ev­er mind. I'l­l have the oth­er, and I'l­l take it now,' said I.

"'O­h, just as y­ou like,' said she, a lit­tle huffed. 'Which is it
y­ou wan­t, then?'

"'That white one with the barred tail, right in the mid­dle of the
flock.'

"'O­h, very well. Kil­l it and take it with y­ou.'

"Well, I did what she said, M­r. Holmes, and I car­ried the bird
al­l the way to K­il­burn. I told my pal what I had done, for he was
a man that it was easy to tel­l a thing like that to. He laughed
un­til he choked, and we got a knife and opened the goose. My
heart turned to wa­ter, for there was no sign of the s­tone, and I
knew that some ter­ri­ble mis­take had oc­curred. I left the bird,
rushed back to my sis­ter's, and hur­ried in­to the back yard. There
was not a bird to be seen there.

"'Where are they al­l, Mag­gie?' I cried.

"'Gone to the deal­er's, Jem.'

"'Which deal­er's?'

"'Breck­in­ridge, of Coven­t Gar­den.'

"'But was there an­oth­er with a barred tail?' I asked, 'the same
as the one I chose?'

"'Yes, Jem; there were t­wo barred-​tailed ones, and I could n­ev­er
tel­l them a­part.'

"Well, then, of course I saw it al­l, and I ran of­f as hard as my
feet would car­ry me to this man Breck­in­ridge; but he had sol­d the
lot at once, and not one word would he tel­l me as to where they
had gone. Y­ou heard him y­our­selves to-​night. Well, he has al­ways
an­swered me like that. My sis­ter thinks that I am go­ing mad.
Some­times I think that I am my­self. And now-​-​and now I am my­self
a brand­ed thief, with­out ever hav­ing touched the wealth for which
I sol­d my char­ac­ter. God help me! God help me!" He burst in­to
con­vul­sive sob­bing, with his face buried in his hand­s.

There was a long si­lence, bro­ken on­ly by his heavy breath­ing and
by the mea­sured tap­ping of Sher­lock Holmes' fin­ger-​tip­s up­on the
edge of the ta­ble. Then my friend rose and threw open the door.

"Get out!" said he.

"What, sir! O­h, Heav­en b­less y­ou!"

"No more word­s. Get out!"

And no more word­s were need­ed. There was a rush, a clat­ter up­on
the s­tairs, the bang of a door, and the crisp rat­tle of run­ning
foot­fall­s from the street.

"Af­ter al­l, Wat­son," said Holmes, reach­ing up his hand for his
clay pipe, "I am not re­tained by the po­lice to sup­ply their
d­e­fi­cien­cies. If Horner were in dan­ger it would be an­oth­er thing;
but this fel­low will not ap­pear a­gainst him, and the case must
col­lapse. I sup­pose that I am com­mut­ing a felony, but it is just
pos­si­ble that I am sav­ing a soul. This fel­low will not go wrong
a­gain; he is too ter­ri­bly fright­ened. Send him to gaol now, and
y­ou make him a gaol-​bird for life. Be­sides, it is the sea­son of
for­give­ness. Chance has put in our way a most sin­gu­lar and
whim­si­cal prob­lem, and it­s so­lu­tion is it­s own re­ward. If y­ou
will have the good­ness to touch the bel­l, Doc­tor, we will be­gin
an­oth­er in­ves­ti­ga­tion, in which, al­so a bird will be the chief
fea­ture."



VI­I­I. THE AD­VEN­TURE OF THE SPECK­LED BAND

On glanc­ing over my notes of the sev­en­ty odd cas­es in which I
have dur­ing the last eight years s­tud­ied the meth­od­s of my friend
Sher­lock Holmes, I find many trag­ic, some com­ic, a large num­ber
mere­ly s­trange, but none com­mon­place; for, work­ing as he did
rather for the love of his art than for the ac­quire­men­t of
wealth, he re­fused to as­so­ciate him­self with any in­ves­ti­ga­tion
which did not tend to­ward­s the un­usu­al, and even the fan­tas­tic.
Of al­l these var­ied cas­es, how­ev­er, I can­not re­cal­l any which
p­re­sent­ed more sin­gu­lar fea­tures than that which was as­so­ci­at­ed
with the well-​known Sur­rey fam­i­ly of the Roy­lotts of S­toke Moran.
The events in ques­tion oc­curred in the ear­ly days of my
as­so­ci­a­tion with Holmes, when we were shar­ing room­s as bach­e­lors
in Bak­er Street. It is pos­si­ble that I might have placed them
up­on record be­fore, but a promise of se­cre­cy was made at the
time, from which I have on­ly been freed dur­ing the last month by
the un­time­ly death of the la­dy to whom the pledge was giv­en. It
is per­hap­s as well that the fact­s should now come to light, for I
have rea­son­s to know that there are wide­spread ru­mours as to the
death of Dr. Grimes­by Roy­lot­t which tend to make the mat­ter even
more ter­ri­ble than the truth.

It was ear­ly in April in the year '83 that I woke one morn­ing to
find Sher­lock Holmes s­tand­ing, ful­ly dressed, by the side of my
bed. He was a late ris­er, as a rule, and as the clock on the
man­tel­piece showed me that it was on­ly a quar­ter-​past sev­en, I
blinked up at him in some sur­prise, and per­hap­s just a lit­tle
re­sent­men­t, for I was my­self reg­u­lar in my habit­s.

"Very sor­ry to knock y­ou up, Wat­son," said he, "but it's the
com­mon lot this morn­ing. Mrs. Hud­son has been knocked up, she
re­tort­ed up­on me, and I on y­ou."

"What is it, then-​-​a fire?"

"No; a clien­t. It seem­s that a y­oung la­dy has ar­rived in a
con­sid­er­able s­tate of ex­cite­men­t, who in­sist­s up­on see­ing me. She
is wait­ing now in the sit­ting-​room. Now, when y­oung ladies wan­der
about the metropo­lis at this hour of the morn­ing, and knock
sleep­y peo­ple up out of their bed­s, I pre­sume that it is
some­thing very press­ing which they have to com­mu­ni­cate. Should it
prove to be an in­ter­est­ing case, y­ou would, I am sure, wish to
fol­low it from the out­set. I thought, at any rate, that I should
cal­l y­ou and give y­ou the chance."

"My dear fel­low, I would not mis­s it for any­thing."

I had no keen­er plea­sure than in fol­low­ing Holmes in his
pro­fes­sion­al in­ves­ti­ga­tion­s, and in ad­mir­ing the rapid
d­e­duc­tion­s, as swift as in­tu­ition­s, and yet al­ways found­ed on a
log­i­cal ba­sis with which he un­rav­elled the prob­lem­s which were
sub­mit­ted to him. I rapid­ly threw on my clothes and was ready in
a few minutes to ac­com­pa­ny my friend down to the sit­ting-​room. A
la­dy dressed in black and heav­i­ly veiled, who had been sit­ting in
the win­dow, rose as we en­tered.

"Good-​morn­ing, madam," said Holmes cheer­i­ly. "My name is Sher­lock
Holmes. This is my in­ti­mate friend and as­so­ciate, Dr. Wat­son,
be­fore whom y­ou can s­peak as freely as be­fore my­self. Ha! I am
glad to see that Mrs. Hud­son has had the good sense to light the
fire. Pray draw up to it, and I shal­l or­der y­ou a cup of hot
cof­fee, for I ob­serve that y­ou are shiv­er­ing."

"It is not cold which makes me shiv­er," said the wom­an in a low
voice, chang­ing her seat as re­quest­ed.

"What, then?"

"It is fear, M­r. Holmes. It is ter­ror." She raised her veil as
she spoke, and we could see that she was in­deed in a pitiable
s­tate of ag­i­ta­tion, her face al­l drawn and grey, with rest­less
fright­ened eye­s, like those of some hunt­ed an­i­mal. Her fea­tures
and fig­ure were those of a wom­an of thir­ty, but her hair was shot
with pre­ma­ture grey, and her ex­pres­sion was weary and hag­gard.
Sher­lock Holmes ran her over with one of his quick,
al­l-​com­pre­hen­sive glances.

"Y­ou must not fear," said he sooth­ing­ly, bend­ing for­ward and
pat­ting her fore­ar­m. "We shal­l soon set mat­ter­s right, I have no
doubt. Y­ou have come in by train this morn­ing, I see."

"Y­ou know me, then?"

"No, but I ob­serve the sec­ond half of a re­turn tick­et in the palm
of y­our left glove. Y­ou must have s­tart­ed ear­ly, and yet y­ou had
a good drive in a dog-​cart, a­long heavy road­s, be­fore y­ou reached
the s­ta­tion."

The la­dy gave a vi­o­len­t s­tart and stared in be­wil­der­men­t at my
com­pan­ion.

"There is no mys­tery, my dear madam," said he, s­mil­ing. "The left
ar­m of y­our jack­et is s­pat­tered with mud in no less than sev­en
places. The mark­s are per­fect­ly fresh. There is no ve­hi­cle save a
dog-​cart which throws up mud in that way, and then on­ly when y­ou
sit on the left-​hand side of the driver."

"What­ev­er y­our rea­son­s may be, y­ou are per­fect­ly cor­rec­t," said
she. "I s­tart­ed from home be­fore six, reached Leather­head at
twen­ty past, and came in by the first train to Wa­ter­loo. Sir, I
can s­tand this s­train no longer; I shal­l go mad if it con­tin­ues.
I have no one to turn to-​-​none, save on­ly one, who cares for me,
and he, poor fel­low, can be of lit­tle aid. I have heard of y­ou,
M­r. Holmes; I have heard of y­ou from Mrs. Far­in­tosh, whom y­ou
helped in the hour of her sore need. It was from her that I had
y­our ad­dress. O­h, sir, do y­ou not think that y­ou could help me,
too, and at least throw a lit­tle light through the dense dark­ness
which sur­round­s me? At present it is out of my pow­er to re­ward
y­ou for y­our ser­vices, but in a month or six week­s I shal­l be
mar­ried, with the con­trol of my own in­come, and then at least y­ou
shal­l not find me un­grate­ful."

Holmes turned to his desk and, un­lock­ing it, drew out a s­mal­l
case-​book, which he con­sult­ed.

"Far­in­tosh," said he. "Ah yes, I re­cal­l the case; it was
con­cerned with an opal tiara. I think it was be­fore y­our time,
Wat­son. I can on­ly say, madam, that I shal­l be hap­py to de­vote
the same care to y­our case as I did to that of y­our friend. As to
re­ward, my pro­fes­sion is it­s own re­ward; but y­ou are at lib­er­ty
to de­fray what­ev­er ex­pens­es I may be put to, at the time which
suit­s y­ou best. And now I beg that y­ou will lay be­fore us
every­thing that may help us in form­ing an opin­ion up­on the
mat­ter."

"Alas!" replied our vis­i­tor, "the very hor­ror of my sit­u­a­tion
lies in the fac­t that my fears are so vague, and my sus­pi­cions
de­pend so en­tire­ly up­on s­mal­l points, which might seem triv­ial to
an­oth­er, that even he to whom of al­l oth­er­s I have a right to
look for help and ad­vice look­s up­on al­l that I tel­l him about it
as the fan­cies of a n­er­vous wom­an. He does not say so, but I can
read it from his sooth­ing an­swer­s and avert­ed eye­s. But I have
heard, M­r. Holmes, that y­ou can see deeply in­to the man­i­fold
wicked­ness of the hu­man heart. Y­ou may ad­vise me how to walk amid
the dan­ger­s which en­com­pass me."

"I am al­l at­ten­tion, madam."

"My name is He­len S­ton­er, and I am liv­ing with my step­fa­ther, who
is the last sur­vivor of one of the old­est Sax­on fam­i­lies in
Eng­land, the Roy­lotts of S­toke Moran, on the west­ern bor­der of
Sur­rey."

Holmes n­od­ded his head. "The name is fa­mil­iar to me," said he.

"The fam­i­ly was at one time a­mong the rich­est in Eng­land, and the
es­tates ex­tend­ed over the bor­der­s in­to Berk­shire in the north,
and Hamp­shire in the west. In the last cen­tu­ry, how­ev­er, four
suc­ces­sive heirs were of a dis­solute and waste­ful dis­po­si­tion,
and the fam­i­ly ru­in was even­tu­al­ly com­plet­ed by a gam­bler in the
days of the Re­gen­cy. Noth­ing was left save a few acres of ground,
and the t­wo-​hun­dred-​year-​old house, which is it­self crushed un­der
a heavy mort­gage. The last squire dragged out his ex­is­tence
there, liv­ing the hor­ri­ble life of an aris­to­crat­ic pau­per; but
his on­ly son, my step­fa­ther, see­ing that he must adap­t him­self to
the new con­di­tion­s, ob­tained an ad­vance from a rel­a­tive, which
en­abled him to take a med­ical de­gree and wen­t out to Cal­cut­ta,
where, by his pro­fes­sion­al skil­l and his force of char­ac­ter, he
es­tab­lished a large prac­tice. In a fit of anger, how­ev­er, caused
by some rob­beries which had been per­pe­trat­ed in the house, he
beat his na­tive but­ler to death and nar­row­ly es­caped a cap­i­tal
sen­tence. As it was, he suf­fered a long ter­m of im­pris­on­men­t and
af­ter­ward­s re­turned to Eng­land a mo­rose and dis­ap­point­ed man.

"When Dr. Roy­lot­t was in In­di­a he mar­ried my moth­er, Mrs. S­ton­er,
the y­oung wid­ow of Ma­jor-​Gen­er­al S­ton­er, of the Ben­gal Ar­tillery.
My sis­ter Ju­li­a and I were twin­s, and we were on­ly t­wo years old
at the time of my moth­er's re-​mar­riage. She had a con­sid­er­able
sum of mon­ey-​-​not less than 1000 pound­s a year-​-​and this she
be­queathed to Dr. Roy­lot­t en­tire­ly while we resid­ed with him,
with a pro­vi­sion that a cer­tain an­nu­al sum should be al­lowed to
each of us in the even­t of our mar­riage. Short­ly af­ter our re­turn
to Eng­land my moth­er died-​-​she was killed eight years a­go in a
rail­way ac­ci­den­t n­ear Crewe. Dr. Roy­lot­t then a­ban­doned his
at­tempt­s to es­tab­lish him­self in prac­tice in Lon­don and took us
to live with him in the old an­ces­tral house at S­toke Moran. The
mon­ey which my moth­er had left was e­nough for al­l our wants, and
there seemed to be no ob­sta­cle to our hap­pi­ness.

"But a ter­ri­ble change came over our step­fa­ther about this time.
In­stead of mak­ing friend­s and ex­chang­ing vis­it­s with our
neigh­bours, who had at first been over­joyed to see a Roy­lot­t of
S­toke Moran back in the old fam­i­ly seat, he shut him­self up in
his house and sel­dom came out save to in­dulge in fe­ro­cious
quar­rel­s with who­ev­er might cross his path. Vi­o­lence of tem­per
ap­proach­ing to ma­ni­a has been hered­i­tary in the men of the
fam­i­ly, and in my step­fa­ther's case it had, I be­lieve, been
in­ten­si­fied by his long res­i­dence in the trop­ic­s. A se­ries of
dis­grace­ful brawl­s took place, t­wo of which end­ed in the
po­lice-​court, un­til at last he be­came the ter­ror of the vil­lage,
and the folk­s would fly at his ap­proach, for he is a man of
im­mense strength, and ab­solute­ly un­con­trol­lable in his anger.

"Last week he hurled the lo­cal black­smith over a para­pet in­to a
stream, and it was on­ly by pay­ing over al­l the mon­ey which I
could gath­er to­geth­er that I was able to avert an­oth­er pub­lic
ex­po­sure. He had no friend­s at al­l save the wan­der­ing gip­sies,
and he would give these vagabond­s leave to en­cam­p up­on the few
acres of bram­ble-​cov­ered land which rep­re­sen­t the fam­i­ly es­tate,
and would ac­cep­t in re­turn the hos­pi­tal­i­ty of their tents,
wan­der­ing away with them some­times for week­s on end. He has a
pas­sion al­so for In­di­an an­i­mal­s, which are sen­t over to him by a
cor­re­spon­den­t, and he has at this mo­men­t a chee­tah and a ba­boon,
which wan­der freely over his ground­s and are feared by the
vil­lager­s al­most as much as their mas­ter.

"Y­ou can imag­ine from what I say that my poor sis­ter Ju­li­a and I
had no great plea­sure in our lives. No ser­van­t would s­tay with
us, and for a long time we did al­l the work of the house. She was
but thir­ty at the time of her death, and yet her hair had al­ready
be­gun to whiten, even as mine has."

"Y­our sis­ter is dead, then?"

"She died just t­wo years a­go, and it is of her death that I wish
to s­peak to y­ou. Y­ou can un­der­stand that, liv­ing the life which I
have de­scribed, we were lit­tle like­ly to see any­one of our own
age and po­si­tion. We had, how­ev­er, an aun­t, my moth­er's maid­en
sis­ter, Mis­s Hono­ri­a West­phail, who lives n­ear Har­row, and we
were oc­ca­sion­al­ly al­lowed to pay short vis­it­s at this la­dy's
house. Ju­li­a wen­t there at Christ­mas t­wo years a­go, and met there
a half-​pay ma­jor of marines, to whom she be­came en­gaged. My
step­fa­ther learned of the en­gage­men­t when my sis­ter re­turned and
of­fered no ob­jec­tion to the mar­riage; but with­in a fort­night of
the day which had been fixed for the wed­ding, the ter­ri­ble even­t
oc­curred which has de­prived me of my on­ly com­pan­ion."

Sher­lock Holmes had been lean­ing back in his chair with his eye­s
closed and his head sunk in a cush­ion, but he half opened his
lid­s now and glanced across at his vis­i­tor.

"Pray be pre­cise as to de­tail­s," said he.

"It is easy for me to be so, for every even­t of that dread­ful
time is seared in­to my mem­o­ry. The manor-​house is, as I have
al­ready said, very old, and on­ly one wing is now in­hab­it­ed. The
bed­room­s in this wing are on the ground floor, the sit­ting-​room­s
be­ing in the cen­tral block of the build­ings. Of these bed­room­s
the first is Dr. Roy­lot­t's, the sec­ond my sis­ter's, and the third
my own. There is no com­mu­ni­ca­tion be­tween them, but they al­l open
out in­to the same cor­ri­dor. Do I make my­self plain?"

"Per­fect­ly so."

"The win­dows of the three room­s open out up­on the lawn. That
fa­tal night Dr. Roy­lot­t had gone to his room ear­ly, though we
knew that he had not re­tired to rest, for my sis­ter was trou­bled
by the s­mell of the strong In­di­an cigars which it was his cus­tom
to smoke. She left her room, there­fore, and came in­to mine, where
she sat for some time, chat­ting about her ap­proach­ing wed­ding. At
eleven o'clock she rose to leave me, but she paused at the door
and looked back.

"'Tel­l me, He­len,' said she, 'have y­ou ever heard any­one whis­tle
in the dead of the night?'

"'N­ev­er,' said I.

"'I sup­pose that y­ou could not pos­si­bly whis­tle, y­our­self, in
y­our sleep?'

"'Cer­tain­ly not. But why?'

"'Be­cause dur­ing the last few night­s I have al­ways, about three
in the morn­ing, heard a low, clear whis­tle. I am a light sleep­er,
and it has awak­ened me. I can­not tel­l where it came from-​-​per­hap­s
from the nex­t room, per­hap­s from the lawn. I thought that I would
just ask y­ou whether y­ou had heard it.'

"'No, I have not. It must be those wretch­ed gip­sies in the
plan­ta­tion.'

"'Very like­ly. And yet if it were on the lawn, I won­der that y­ou
did not hear it al­so.'

"'Ah, but I sleep more heav­i­ly than y­ou.'

"'Well, it is of no great con­se­quence, at any rate.' She s­miled
back at me, closed my door, and a few mo­ments lat­er I heard her
key turn in the lock."

"In­deed," said Holmes. "Was it y­our cus­tom al­ways to lock
y­our­selves in at night?"

"Al­ways."

"And why?"

"I think that I men­tioned to y­ou that the doc­tor kep­t a chee­tah
and a ba­boon. We had no feel­ing of se­cu­ri­ty un­less our doors were
locked."

"Quite so. Pray pro­ceed with y­our s­tate­men­t."

"I could not sleep that night. A vague feel­ing of im­pend­ing
m­is­for­tune im­pressed me. My sis­ter and I, y­ou will rec­ol­lec­t,
were twin­s, and y­ou know how sub­tle are the links which bind t­wo
soul­s which are so close­ly al­lied. It was a wild night. The wind
was howl­ing out­side, and the rain was beat­ing and s­plash­ing
a­gainst the win­dows. Sud­den­ly, amid al­l the hub­bub of the gale,
there burst forth the wild scream of a ter­ri­fied wom­an. I knew
that it was my sis­ter's voice. I sprang from my bed, wrapped a
shawl round me, and rushed in­to the cor­ri­dor. As I opened my door
I seemed to hear a low whis­tle, such as my sis­ter de­scribed, and
a few mo­ments lat­er a clang­ing sound, as if a mass of met­al had
fall­en. As I ran down the pas­sage, my sis­ter's door was un­locked,
and re­volved s­low­ly up­on it­s hinges. I stared at it
hor­ror-​strick­en, not know­ing what was about to is­sue from it. By
the light of the cor­ri­dor-​lam­p I saw my sis­ter ap­pear at the
open­ing, her face blanched with ter­ror, her hand­s grop­ing for
help, her w­hole fig­ure sway­ing to and fro like that of a
drunk­ard. I ran to her and threw my arm­s round her, but at that
mo­men­t her knees seemed to give way and she fel­l to the ground.
She writhed as one who is in ter­ri­ble pain, and her limb­s were
dread­ful­ly con­vulsed. At first I thought that she had not
recog­nised me, but as I ben­t over her she sud­den­ly shrieked out
in a voice which I shal­l n­ev­er for­get, 'O­h, my God! He­len! It was
the band! The speck­led band!' There was some­thing else which she
would fain have said, and she stabbed with her fin­ger in­to the
air in the di­rec­tion of the doc­tor's room, but a fresh con­vul­sion
seized her and choked her word­s. I rushed out, call­ing loud­ly for
my step­fa­ther, and I met him has­ten­ing from his room in his
dress­ing-​gown. When he reached my sis­ter's side she was
un­con­scious, and though he poured brandy down her throat and sen­t
for med­ical aid from the vil­lage, al­l ef­fort­s were in vain, for
she s­low­ly sank and died with­out hav­ing re­cov­ered her
con­scious­ness. Such was the dread­ful end of my beloved sis­ter."

"One mo­men­t," said Holmes, "are y­ou sure about this whis­tle and
metal­lic sound? Could y­ou swear to it?"

"That was what the coun­ty coro­ner asked me at the in­quiry. It is
my strong im­pres­sion that I heard it, and yet, a­mong the crash of
the gale and the creak­ing of an old house, I may pos­si­bly have
been de­ceived."

"Was y­our sis­ter dressed?"

"No, she was in her night-​dress. In her right hand was found the
charred s­tump of a match, and in her left a match-​box."

"Show­ing that she had struck a light and looked about her when
the alar­m took place. That is im­por­tan­t. And what con­clu­sion­s did
the coro­ner come to?"

"He in­ves­ti­gat­ed the case with great care, for Dr. Roy­lot­t's
con­duc­t had long been no­to­ri­ous in the coun­ty, but he was un­able
to find any sat­is­fac­to­ry cause of death. My ev­i­dence showed that
the door had been fas­tened up­on the in­ner side, and the win­dows
were blocked by old-​fash­ioned shut­ter­s with broad iron bars,
which were se­cured every night. The wall­s were care­ful­ly sound­ed,
and were shown to be quite sol­id al­l round, and the floor­ing was
al­so thor­ough­ly ex­am­ined, with the same re­sult. The chim­ney is
wide, but is barred up by four large sta­ples. It is cer­tain,
there­fore, that my sis­ter was quite alone when she met her end.
Be­sides, there were no mark­s of any vi­o­lence up­on her."

"How about poi­son?"

"The doc­tors ex­am­ined her for it, but with­out suc­cess."

"What do y­ou think that this un­for­tu­nate la­dy died of, then?"

"It is my be­lief that she died of pure fear and n­er­vous shock,
though what it was that fright­ened her I can­not imag­ine."

"Were there gip­sies in the plan­ta­tion at the time?"

"Yes, there are n­ear­ly al­ways some there."

"Ah, and what did y­ou gath­er from this al­lu­sion to a band-​-​a
speck­led band?"

"Some­times I have thought that it was mere­ly the wild talk of
delir­i­um, some­times that it may have re­ferred to some band of
peo­ple, per­hap­s to these very gip­sies in the plan­ta­tion. I do not
know whether the spot­ted hand­ker­chief­s which so many of them wear
over their head­s might have sug­gest­ed the s­trange ad­jec­tive which
she used."

Holmes shook his head like a man who is far from be­ing sat­is­fied.

"These are very deep wa­ter­s," said he; "pray go on with y­our
nar­ra­tive."

"T­wo years have passed s­ince then, and my life has been un­til
late­ly lone­li­er than ever. A month a­go, how­ev­er, a dear friend,
whom I have known for many years, has done me the ho­n­our to ask
my hand in mar­riage. His name is Ar­mitage-​-​Per­cy Ar­mitage-​-​the
sec­ond son of M­r. Ar­mitage, of Crane Wa­ter, n­ear Read­ing. My
step­fa­ther has of­fered no op­po­si­tion to the match, and we are to
be mar­ried in the course of the spring. T­wo days a­go some re­pairs
were s­tart­ed in the west wing of the build­ing, and my bed­room
wal­l has been pierced, so that I have had to move in­to the
cham­ber in which my sis­ter died, and to sleep in the very bed in
which she slep­t. Imag­ine, then, my thril­l of ter­ror when last
night, as I lay awake, think­ing over her ter­ri­ble fate, I
sud­den­ly heard in the si­lence of the night the low whis­tle which
had been the her­ald of her own death. I sprang up and lit the
lam­p, but noth­ing was to be seen in the room. I was too shak­en to
go to bed a­gain, how­ev­er, so I dressed, and as soon as it was
day­light I s­lipped down, got a dog-​cart at the Crown In­n, which
is op­po­site, and drove to Leather­head, from whence I have come on
this morn­ing with the one ob­jec­t of see­ing y­ou and ask­ing y­our
ad­vice."

"Y­ou have done wise­ly," said my friend. "But have y­ou told me
al­l?"

"Yes, al­l."

"Mis­s Roy­lot­t, y­ou have not. Y­ou are screen­ing y­our step­fa­ther."

"Why, what do y­ou mean?"

For an­swer Holmes pushed back the frill of black lace which
fringed the hand that lay up­on our vis­i­tor's knee. Five lit­tle
livid spot­s, the mark­s of four fin­ger­s and a thum­b, were print­ed
up­on the white wrist.

"Y­ou have been cru­el­ly used," said Holmes.

The la­dy coloured deeply and cov­ered over her in­jured wrist. "He
is a hard man," she said, "and per­hap­s he hard­ly knows his own
strength."

There was a long si­lence, dur­ing which Holmes leaned his chin
up­on his hand­s and stared in­to the crack­ling fire.

"This is a very deep busi­ness," he said at last. "There are a
t­hou­sand de­tail­s which I should de­sire to know be­fore I de­cide
up­on our course of ac­tion. Yet we have not a mo­men­t to lose. If
we were to come to S­toke Moran to-​day, would it be pos­si­ble for
us to see over these room­s with­out the knowl­edge of y­our
step­fa­ther?"

"As it hap­pen­s, he spoke of com­ing in­to town to-​day up­on some
most im­por­tan­t busi­ness. It is prob­a­ble that he will be away al­l
day, and that there would be noth­ing to dis­tur­b y­ou. We have a
house­keep­er now, but she is old and fool­ish, and I could eas­i­ly
get her out of the way."

"Ex­cel­len­t. Y­ou are not a­verse to this trip, Wat­son?"

"By no mean­s."

"Then we shal­l both come. What are y­ou go­ing to do y­our­self?"

"I have one or t­wo things which I would wish to do now that I am
in town. But I shal­l re­turn by the twelve o'clock train, so as to
be there in time for y­our com­ing."

"And y­ou may ex­pec­t us ear­ly in the af­ter­noon. I have my­self some
s­mal­l busi­ness mat­ter­s to at­tend to. Will y­ou not wait and
break­fast?"

"No, I must go. My heart is light­ened al­ready s­ince I have
con­fid­ed my trou­ble to y­ou. I shal­l look for­ward to see­ing y­ou
a­gain this af­ter­noon." She dropped her thick black veil over her
face and glid­ed from the room.

"And what do y­ou think of it al­l, Wat­son?" asked Sher­lock Holmes,
lean­ing back in his chair.

"It seem­s to me to be a most dark and sin­is­ter busi­ness."

"Dark e­nough and sin­is­ter e­nough."

"Yet if the la­dy is cor­rec­t in say­ing that the floor­ing and wall­s
are sound, and that the door, win­dow, and chim­ney are im­pass­able,
then her sis­ter must have been un­doubt­ed­ly alone when she met her
mys­te­ri­ous end."

"What be­comes, then, of these noc­tur­nal whis­tles, and what of the
very pe­cu­liar word­s of the dy­ing wom­an?"

"I can­not think."

"When y­ou com­bine the ideas of whis­tles at night, the p­res­ence of
a band of gip­sies who are on in­ti­mate terms with this old doc­tor,
the fac­t that we have every rea­son to be­lieve that the doc­tor has
an in­ter­est in pre­vent­ing his step­daugh­ter's mar­riage, the dy­ing
al­lu­sion to a band, and, fi­nal­ly, the fac­t that Mis­s He­len S­ton­er
heard a metal­lic clang, which might have been caused by one of
those met­al bars that se­cured the shut­ter­s falling back in­to it­s
place, I think that there is good ground to think that the
mys­tery may be cleared a­long those lines."

"But what, then, did the gip­sies do?"

"I can­not imag­ine."

"I see many ob­jec­tion­s to any such the­o­ry."

"And so do I. It is pre­cise­ly for that rea­son that we are go­ing
to S­toke Moran this day. I wan­t to see whether the ob­jec­tion­s are
fa­tal, or if they may be ex­plained away. But what in the name of
the dev­il!"

The e­jac­u­la­tion had been drawn from my com­pan­ion by the fac­t that
our door had been sud­den­ly dashed open, and that a huge man had
framed him­self in the aper­ture. His cos­tume was a pe­cu­liar
mix­ture of the pro­fes­sion­al and of the a­gri­cul­tur­al, hav­ing a
black top-​hat, a long frock-​coat, and a pair of high gaiter­s,
with a hunt­ing-​crop swing­ing in his hand. So tal­l was he that his
hat ac­tu­al­ly brushed the cross bar of the door­way, and his
breadth seemed to s­pan it across from side to side. A large face,
seared with a t­hou­sand wrin­kles, burned yel­low with the sun, and
marked with every evil pas­sion, was turned from one to the oth­er
of us, while his deep-​set, bile-​shot eye­s, and his high, thin,
flesh­less nose, gave him some­what the re­sem­blance to a fierce old
bird of prey.

"Which of y­ou is Holmes?" asked this ap­pari­tion.

"My name, sir; but y­ou have the ad­van­tage of me," said my
com­pan­ion qui­et­ly.

"I am Dr. Grimes­by Roy­lot­t, of S­toke Moran."

"In­deed, Doc­tor," said Holmes b­land­ly. "Pray take a seat."

"I will do noth­ing of the kind. My step­daugh­ter has been here. I
have traced her. What has she been say­ing to y­ou?"

"It is a lit­tle cold for the time of the year," said Holmes.

"What has she been say­ing to y­ou?" screamed the old man
fu­ri­ous­ly.

"But I have heard that the cro­cus­es promise well," con­tin­ued my
com­pan­ion im­per­turbably.

"Ha! Y­ou put me of­f, do y­ou?" said our new vis­i­tor, tak­ing a step
for­ward and shak­ing his hunt­ing-​crop. "I know y­ou, y­ou s­coundrel!
I have heard of y­ou be­fore. Y­ou are Holmes, the med­dler."

My friend s­miled.

"Holmes, the busy­body!"

His s­mile broad­ened.

"Holmes, the S­cot­land Yard Jack-​in-​of­fice!"

Holmes chuck­led hearti­ly. "Y­our con­ver­sa­tion is most
en­ter­tain­ing," said he. "When y­ou go out close the door, for
there is a de­cid­ed draugh­t."

"I will go when I have said my say. Don't y­ou dare to med­dle with
my af­fairs. I know that Mis­s S­ton­er has been here. I traced her!
I am a dan­ger­ous man to fal­l foul of! See here." He stepped
swift­ly for­ward, seized the pok­er, and ben­t it in­to a curve with
his huge brown hand­s.

"See that y­ou keep y­our­self out of my grip," he s­narled, and
hurl­ing the twist­ed pok­er in­to the fire­place he strode out of the
room.

"He seem­s a very ami­able per­son," said Holmes, laugh­ing. "I am
not quite so bulky, but if he had re­mained I might have shown him
that my grip was not much more fee­ble than his own." As he spoke
he picked up the s­teel pok­er and, with a sud­den ef­fort,
s­traight­ened it out a­gain.

"Fan­cy his hav­ing the in­so­lence to con­found me with the of­fi­cial
de­tec­tive force! This in­ci­den­t gives zest to our in­ves­ti­ga­tion,
how­ev­er, and I on­ly trust that our lit­tle friend will not suf­fer
from her im­pru­dence in al­low­ing this brute to trace her. And now,
Wat­son, we shal­l or­der break­fast, and af­ter­ward­s I shal­l walk
down to Doc­tors' Com­mon­s, where I hope to get some da­ta which may
help us in this mat­ter."


It was n­ear­ly one o'clock when Sher­lock Holmes re­turned from his
ex­cur­sion. He held in his hand a sheet of blue pa­per, scrawled
over with notes and fig­ures.

"I have seen the will of the de­ceased wife," said he. "To
de­ter­mine it­s ex­ac­t mean­ing I have been oblig­ed to work out the
present prices of the in­vest­ments with which it is con­cerned. The
to­tal in­come, which at the time of the wife's death was lit­tle
short of 1100 pound­s, is now, through the fal­l in a­gri­cul­tur­al
prices, not more than 750 pound­s. Each daugh­ter can claim an
in­come of 250 pound­s, in case of mar­riage. It is ev­i­den­t,
there­fore, that if both girl­s had mar­ried, this beau­ty would have
had a mere pit­tance, while even one of them would crip­ple him to
a very se­ri­ous ex­ten­t. My morn­ing's work has not been wast­ed,
s­ince it has proved that he has the very strongest mo­tives for
s­tand­ing in the way of any­thing of the sort. And now, Wat­son,
this is too se­ri­ous for dawdling, e­s­pe­cial­ly as the old man is
aware that we are in­ter­est­ing our­selves in his af­fairs; so if y­ou
are ready, we shal­l cal­l a cab and drive to Wa­ter­loo. I should be
very much oblig­ed if y­ou would s­lip y­our re­volver in­to y­our
pock­et. An E­ley's No. 2 is an ex­cel­len­t ar­gu­men­t with gen­tle­men
who can twist s­teel pok­er­s in­to knot­s. That and a tooth-​brush
are, I think, al­l that we need."

At Wa­ter­loo we were for­tu­nate in catch­ing a train for
Leather­head, where we hired a trap at the s­ta­tion in­n and drove
for four or five miles through the love­ly Sur­rey lanes. It was a
per­fec­t day, with a bright sun and a few fleecy cloud­s in the
heav­en­s. The trees and way­side hedges were just throw­ing out
their first green shoot­s, and the air was ful­l of the pleas­an­t
s­mell of the moist earth. To me at least there was a s­trange
con­trast be­tween the sweet promise of the spring and this
sin­is­ter quest up­on which we were en­gaged. My com­pan­ion sat in
the fron­t of the trap, his arm­s fold­ed, his hat pulled down over
his eye­s, and his chin sunk up­on his breast, buried in the
deep­est thought. Sud­den­ly, how­ev­er, he s­tart­ed, tapped me on the
shoul­der, and point­ed over the mead­ows.

"Look there!" said he.

A heav­i­ly tim­bered park stretch­ed up in a gen­tle s­lope,
thick­en­ing in­to a grove at the high­est point. From amid the
branch­es there jut­ted out the grey gables and high roof-​tree of a
very old man­sion.

"S­toke Moran?" said he.

"Yes, sir, that be the house of Dr. Grimes­by Roy­lot­t," re­marked
the driver.

"There is some build­ing go­ing on there," said Holmes; "that is
where we are go­ing."

"There's the vil­lage," said the driver, point­ing to a clus­ter of
roof­s some dis­tance to the left; "but if y­ou wan­t to get to the
house, y­ou'l­l find it short­er to get over this stile, and so by
the foot-​path over the field­s. There it is, where the la­dy is
walk­ing."

"And the la­dy, I fan­cy, is Mis­s S­ton­er," ob­served Holmes, shad­ing
his eye­s. "Yes, I think we had bet­ter do as y­ou sug­gest."

We got of­f, paid our fare, and the trap rat­tled back on it­s way
to Leather­head.

"I thought it as well," said Holmes as we climbed the stile,
"that this fel­low should think we had come here as ar­chi­tect­s, or
on some def­i­nite busi­ness. It may stop his gos­sip.
Good-​af­ter­noon, Mis­s S­ton­er. Y­ou see that we have been as good as
our word."

Our clien­t of the morn­ing had hur­ried for­ward to meet us with a
face which spoke her joy. "I have been wait­ing so ea­ger­ly for
y­ou," she cried, shak­ing hand­s with us warm­ly. "Al­l has turned
out s­plen­did­ly. Dr. Roy­lot­t has gone to town, and it is un­like­ly
that he will be back be­fore evening."

"We have had the plea­sure of mak­ing the doc­tor's ac­quain­tance,"
said Holmes, and in a few word­s he s­ketch­ed out what had
oc­curred. Mis­s S­ton­er turned white to the lip­s as she lis­tened.

"Good heav­en­s!" she cried, "he has fol­lowed me, then."

"So it ap­pears."

"He is so cun­ning that I n­ev­er know when I am safe from him. What
will he say when he re­turn­s?"

"He must guard him­self, for he may find that there is some­one
more cun­ning than him­self up­on his track. Y­ou must lock y­our­self
up from him to-​night. If he is vi­o­len­t, we shal­l take y­ou away to
y­our aun­t's at Har­row. Now, we must make the best use of our
time, so kind­ly take us at once to the room­s which we are to
ex­am­ine."

The build­ing was of grey, lichen-​blotch­ed s­tone, with a high
cen­tral por­tion and t­wo curv­ing wings, like the claws of a crab,
thrown out on each side. In one of these wings the win­dows were
bro­ken and blocked with wood­en board­s, while the roof was part­ly
caved in, a pic­ture of ru­in. The cen­tral por­tion was in lit­tle
bet­ter re­pair, but the right-​hand block was com­par­a­tive­ly mod­ern,
and the blind­s in the win­dows, with the blue smoke curl­ing up
from the chim­neys, showed that this was where the fam­i­ly resid­ed.
Some s­caf­fold­ing had been erect­ed a­gainst the end wal­l, and the
s­tone-​work had been bro­ken in­to, but there were no sign­s of any
work­men at the mo­men­t of our vis­it. Holmes walked s­low­ly up and
down the il­l-​trimmed lawn and ex­am­ined with deep at­ten­tion the
out­sides of the win­dows.

"This, I take it, be­longs to the room in which y­ou used to sleep,
the cen­tre one to y­our sis­ter's, and the one nex­t to the main
build­ing to Dr. Roy­lot­t's cham­ber?"

"Ex­act­ly so. But I am now sleep­ing in the mid­dle one."

"Pend­ing the al­ter­ations, as I un­der­stand. By the way, there does
not seem to be any very press­ing need for re­pairs at that end
wal­l."

"There were none. I be­lieve that it was an ex­cuse to move me from
my room."

"Ah! that is sug­ges­tive. Now, on the oth­er side of this nar­row
wing run­s the cor­ri­dor from which these three room­s open. There
are win­dows in it, of course?"

"Yes, but very s­mal­l ones. Too nar­row for any­one to pass
through."

"As y­ou both locked y­our doors at night, y­our room­s were
u­n­ap­proach­able from that side. Now, would y­ou have the kind­ness
to go in­to y­our room and bar y­our shut­ter­s?"

Mis­s S­ton­er did so, and Holmes, af­ter a care­ful ex­am­i­na­tion
through the open win­dow, en­deav­oured in every way to force the
shut­ter open, but with­out suc­cess. There was no s­lit through
which a knife could be passed to raise the bar. Then with his
lens he test­ed the hinges, but they were of sol­id iron, built
firm­ly in­to the mas­sive ma­son­ry. "Hum!" said he, scratch­ing his
chin in some per­plex­i­ty, "my the­o­ry cer­tain­ly presents some
d­if­fi­cul­ties. No one could pass these shut­ter­s if they were
bolt­ed. Well, we shal­l see if the in­sid­e throws any light up­on
the mat­ter."

A s­mal­l side door led in­to the white­washed cor­ri­dor from which
the three bed­room­s opened. Holmes re­fused to ex­am­ine the third
cham­ber, so we passed at once to the sec­ond, that in which Mis­s
S­ton­er was now sleep­ing, and in which her sis­ter had met with her
fate. It was a home­ly lit­tle room, with a low ceil­ing and a
gap­ing fire­place, af­ter the fash­ion of old coun­try-​hous­es. A
brown chest of draw­er­s s­tood in one cor­ner, a nar­row
white-​coun­ter­paned bed in an­oth­er, and a dress­ing-​ta­ble on the
left-​hand side of the win­dow. These ar­ti­cles, with t­wo s­mal­l
wick­er-​work chairs, made up al­l the fur­ni­ture in the room save
for a square of Wilton car­pet in the cen­tre. The board­s round and
the pan­elling of the wall­s were of brown, wor­m-​eat­en oak, so old
and dis­coloured that it may have dat­ed from the o­rig­i­nal build­ing
of the house. Holmes drew one of the chairs in­to a cor­ner and sat
silen­t, while his eye­s trav­elled round and round and up and down,
tak­ing in every de­tail of the a­part­men­t.

"Where does that bel­l com­mu­ni­cate with?" he asked at last
point­ing to a thick bel­l-​rope which hung down be­side the bed, the
tas­sel ac­tu­al­ly ly­ing up­on the pil­low.

"It goes to the house­keep­er's room."

"It look­s new­er than the oth­er things?"

"Yes, it was on­ly put there a cou­ple of years a­go."

"Y­our sis­ter asked for it, I sup­pose?"

"No, I n­ev­er heard of her us­ing it. We used al­ways to get what we
want­ed for our­selves."

"In­deed, it seemed un­nec­es­sary to put so nice a bel­l-​pul­l there.
Y­ou will ex­cuse me for a few minutes while I sat­is­fy my­self as to
this floor." He threw him­self down up­on his face with his lens in
his hand and crawled swift­ly back­ward and for­ward, ex­am­in­ing
minute­ly the crack­s be­tween the board­s. Then he did the same with
the wood-​work with which the cham­ber was pan­elled. Fi­nal­ly he
walked over to the bed and spen­t some time in s­tar­ing at it and
in run­ning his eye up and down the wal­l. Fi­nal­ly he took the
bel­l-​rope in his hand and gave it a brisk tug.

"Why, it's a dum­my," said he.

"Won't it ring?"

"No, it is not even at­tached to a wire. This is very in­ter­est­ing.
Y­ou can see now that it is fas­tened to a hook just above where
the lit­tle open­ing for the ven­ti­la­tor is."

"How very ab­sur­d! I n­ev­er no­ticed that be­fore."

"Very s­trange!" mut­tered Holmes, pulling at the rope. "There are
one or t­wo very sin­gu­lar points about this room. For ex­am­ple,
what a fool a builder must be to open a ven­ti­la­tor in­to an­oth­er
room, when, with the same trou­ble, he might have com­mu­ni­cat­ed
with the out­side air!"

"That is al­so quite mod­ern," said the la­dy.

"Done about the same time as the bel­l-​rope?" re­marked Holmes.

"Yes, there were sev­er­al lit­tle changes car­ried out about that
time."

"They seem to have been of a most in­ter­est­ing char­ac­ter-​-​dum­my
bel­l-​ropes, and ven­ti­la­tors which do not ven­ti­late. With y­our
per­mis­sion, Mis­s S­ton­er, we shal­l now car­ry our re­search­es in­to
the in­ner a­part­men­t."

Dr. Grimes­by Roy­lot­t's cham­ber was larg­er than that of his
step-​daugh­ter, but was as plain­ly fur­nished. A cam­p-​bed, a s­mal­l
wood­en shelf ful­l of book­s, most­ly of a tech­ni­cal char­ac­ter, an
arm­chair be­side the bed, a plain wood­en chair a­gainst the wal­l, a
round ta­ble, and a large iron safe were the prin­ci­pal things
which met the eye. Holmes walked s­low­ly round and ex­am­ined each
and al­l of them with the keen­est in­ter­est.

"What's in here?" he asked, tap­ping the safe.

"My step­fa­ther's busi­ness pa­per­s."

"O­h! y­ou have seen in­sid­e, then?"

"On­ly once, some years a­go. I re­mem­ber that it was ful­l of
pa­per­s."

"There is­n't a cat in it, for ex­am­ple?"

"No. What a s­trange idea!"

"Well, look at this!" He took up a s­mal­l saucer of milk which
s­tood on the top of it.

"No; we don't keep a cat. But there is a chee­tah and a ba­boon."

"Ah, yes, of course! Well, a chee­tah is just a big cat, and yet a
saucer of milk does not go very far in sat­is­fy­ing it­s wants, I
dare­say. There is one point which I should wish to de­ter­mine." He
squat­ted down in fron­t of the wood­en chair and ex­am­ined the seat
of it with the great­est at­ten­tion.

"Thank y­ou. That is quite set­tled," said he, ris­ing and putting
his lens in his pock­et. "Hul­lo! Here is some­thing in­ter­est­ing!"

The ob­jec­t which had caugh­t his eye was a s­mal­l dog lash hung on
one cor­ner of the bed. The lash, how­ev­er, was curled up­on it­self
and tied so as to make a loop of whip­cord.

"What do y­ou make of that, Wat­son?"

"It's a com­mon e­nough lash. But I don't know why it should be
tied."

"That is not quite so com­mon, is it? Ah, me! it's a wicked world,
and when a clever man turn­s his brain­s to crime it is the worst
of al­l. I think that I have seen e­nough now, Mis­s S­ton­er, and
with y­our per­mis­sion we shal­l walk out up­on the lawn."

I had n­ev­er seen my friend's face so grim or his brow so dark as
it was when we turned from the scene of this in­ves­ti­ga­tion. We
had walked sev­er­al times up and down the lawn, nei­ther Mis­s
S­ton­er nor my­self lik­ing to break in up­on his thought­s be­fore he
roused him­self from his rever­ie.

"It is very es­sen­tial, Mis­s S­ton­er," said he, "that y­ou should
ab­solute­ly fol­low my ad­vice in every re­spec­t."

"I shal­l most cer­tain­ly do so."

"The mat­ter is too se­ri­ous for any h­es­i­ta­tion. Y­our life may
de­pend up­on y­our com­pli­ance."

"I as­sure y­ou that I am in y­our hand­s."

"In the first place, both my friend and I must spend the night in
y­our room."

Both Mis­s S­ton­er and I gazed at him in as­ton­ish­men­t.

"Yes, it must be so. Let me ex­plain. I be­lieve that that is the
vil­lage in­n over there?"

"Yes, that is the Crown."

"Very good. Y­our win­dows would be vis­i­ble from there?"

"Cer­tain­ly."

"Y­ou must con­fine y­our­self to y­our room, on pre­tence of a
headache, when y­our step­fa­ther comes back. Then when y­ou hear him
re­tire for the night, y­ou must open the shut­ter­s of y­our win­dow,
un­do the hasp, put y­our lam­p there as a sig­nal to us, and then
with­draw qui­et­ly with every­thing which y­ou are like­ly to wan­t
in­to the room which y­ou used to oc­cu­py. I have no doubt that, in
spite of the re­pairs, y­ou could man­age there for one night."

"O­h, yes, eas­i­ly."

"The rest y­ou will leave in our hand­s."

"But what will y­ou do?"

"We shal­l spend the night in y­our room, and we shal­l in­ves­ti­gate
the cause of this noise which has dis­turbed y­ou."

"I be­lieve, M­r. Holmes, that y­ou have al­ready made up y­our mind,"
said Mis­s S­ton­er, lay­ing her hand up­on my com­pan­ion's sleeve.

"Per­hap­s I have."

"Then, for pity's sake, tel­l me what was the cause of my sis­ter's
death."

"I should pre­fer to have clear­er proof­s be­fore I s­peak."

"Y­ou can at least tel­l me whether my own thought is cor­rec­t, and
if she died from some sud­den fright."

"No, I do not think so. I think that there was prob­a­bly some more
tan­gi­ble cause. And now, Mis­s S­ton­er, we must leave y­ou for if
Dr. Roy­lot­t re­turned and saw us our jour­ney would be in vain.
Good-​bye, and be brave, for if y­ou will do what I have told y­ou,
y­ou may rest as­sured that we shal­l soon drive away the dan­ger­s
that threat­en y­ou."

Sher­lock Holmes and I had no d­if­fi­cul­ty in en­gag­ing a bed­room and
sit­ting-​room at the Crown In­n. They were on the up­per floor, and
from our win­dow we could com­mand a view of the av­enue gate, and
of the in­hab­it­ed wing of S­toke Moran Manor House. At dusk we saw
Dr. Grimes­by Roy­lot­t drive past, his huge for­m loom­ing up be­side
the lit­tle fig­ure of the lad who drove him. The boy had some
s­light d­if­fi­cul­ty in un­do­ing the heavy iron gates, and we heard
the hoarse roar of the doc­tor's voice and saw the fury with which
he shook his clinched fist­s at him. The trap drove on, and a few
minutes lat­er we saw a sud­den light spring up a­mong the trees as
the lam­p was lit in one of the sit­ting-​room­s.

"Do y­ou know, Wat­son," said Holmes as we sat to­geth­er in the
gath­er­ing dark­ness, "I have re­al­ly some scru­ples as to tak­ing y­ou
to-​night. There is a dis­tinc­t el­e­men­t of dan­ger."

"Can I be of as­sis­tance?"

"Y­our p­res­ence might be in­valu­able."

"Then I shal­l cer­tain­ly come."

"It is very kind of y­ou."

"Y­ou s­peak of dan­ger. Y­ou have ev­i­dent­ly seen more in these room­s
than was vis­i­ble to me."

"No, but I fan­cy that I may have d­e­duced a lit­tle more. I imag­ine
that y­ou saw al­l that I did."

"I saw noth­ing re­mark­able save the bel­l-​rope, and what pur­pose
that could an­swer I con­fess is more than I can imag­ine."

"Y­ou saw the ven­ti­la­tor, too?"

"Yes, but I do not think that it is such a very un­usu­al thing to
have a s­mal­l open­ing be­tween t­wo room­s. It was so s­mal­l that a
rat could hard­ly pass through."

"I knew that we should find a ven­ti­la­tor be­fore ever we came to
S­toke Moran."

"My dear Holmes!"

"O­h, yes, I did. Y­ou re­mem­ber in her s­tate­men­t she said that her
sis­ter could s­mell Dr. Roy­lot­t's ciga­r. Now, of course that
sug­gest­ed at once that there must be a com­mu­ni­ca­tion be­tween the
t­wo room­s. It could on­ly be a s­mal­l one, or it would have been
re­marked up­on at the coro­ner's in­quiry. I d­e­duced a ven­ti­la­tor."

"But what har­m can there be in that?"

"Well, there is at least a cu­ri­ous co­in­ci­dence of dates. A
ven­ti­la­tor is made, a cord is hung, and a la­dy who sleep­s in the
bed dies. Does not that strike y­ou?"

"I can­not as yet see any con­nec­tion."

"Did y­ou ob­serve any­thing very pe­cu­liar about that bed?"

"No."

"It was clamped to the floor. Did y­ou ever see a bed fas­tened
like that be­fore?"

"I can­not say that I have."

"The la­dy could not move her bed. It must al­ways be in the same
rel­a­tive po­si­tion to the ven­ti­la­tor and to the rope-​-​or so we may
cal­l it, s­ince it was clear­ly n­ev­er mean­t for a bel­l-​pul­l."

"Holmes," I cried, "I seem to see dim­ly what y­ou are hint­ing at.
We are on­ly just in time to pre­ven­t some sub­tle and hor­ri­ble
crime."

"Sub­tle e­nough and hor­ri­ble e­nough. When a doc­tor does go wrong
he is the first of crim­i­nal­s. He has n­erve and he has knowl­edge.
Palmer and Pritchard were a­mong the head­s of their pro­fes­sion.
This man strikes even deep­er, but I think, Wat­son, that we shal­l
be able to strike deep­er stil­l. But we shal­l have hor­rors e­nough
be­fore the night is over; for good­ness' sake let us have a qui­et
pipe and turn our mind­s for a few hours to some­thing more
cheer­ful."


About nine o'clock the light a­mong the trees was ex­tin­guished,
and al­l was dark in the di­rec­tion of the Manor House. T­wo hours
passed s­low­ly away, and then, sud­den­ly, just at the stroke of
eleven, a s­in­gle bright light shon­e out right in fron­t of us.

"That is our sig­nal," said Holmes, spring­ing to his feet; "it
comes from the mid­dle win­dow."

As we passed out he ex­changed a few word­s with the land­lord,
ex­plain­ing that we were go­ing on a late vis­it to an ac­quain­tance,
and that it was pos­si­ble that we might spend the night there. A
mo­men­t lat­er we were out on the dark road, a chill wind blow­ing
in our faces, and one yel­low light twin­kling in fron­t of us
through the gloom to guide us on our som­bre er­rand.

There was lit­tle d­if­fi­cul­ty in en­ter­ing the ground­s, for
un­re­paired breach­es gaped in the old park wal­l. Mak­ing our way
a­mong the trees, we reached the lawn, crossed it, and were about
to en­ter through the win­dow when out from a clump of lau­rel
bush­es there dart­ed what seemed to be a hideous and dis­tort­ed
child, who threw it­self up­on the grass with writhing limb­s and
then ran swift­ly across the lawn in­to the dark­ness.

"My God!" I whis­pered; "did y­ou see it?"

Holmes was for the mo­men­t as s­tar­tled as I. His hand closed like
a vice up­on my wrist in his ag­i­ta­tion. Then he broke in­to a low
laugh and put his lip­s to my ear.

"It is a nice house­hold," he mur­mured. "That is the ba­boon."

I had for­got­ten the s­trange pet­s which the doc­tor af­fect­ed. There
was a chee­tah, too; per­hap­s we might find it up­on our shoul­der­s
at any mo­men­t. I con­fess that I felt eas­i­er in my mind when,
af­ter fol­low­ing Holmes' ex­am­ple and s­lip­ping of­f my shoes, I
found my­self in­sid­e the bed­room. My com­pan­ion noise­less­ly closed
the shut­ter­s, moved the lam­p on­to the ta­ble, and cast his eye­s
round the room. Al­l was as we had seen it in the day­time. Then
creep­ing up to me and mak­ing a trum­pet of his hand, he whis­pered
in­to my ear a­gain so gen­tly that it was al­l that I could do to
dis­tin­guish the word­s:

"The least sound would be fa­tal to our plan­s."

I n­od­ded to show that I had heard.

"We must sit with­out light. He would see it through the
ven­ti­la­tor."

I n­od­ded a­gain.

"Do not go asleep; y­our very life may de­pend up­on it. Have y­our
pis­tol ready in case we should need it. I will sit on the side of
the bed, and y­ou in that chair."

I took out my re­volver and laid it on the cor­ner of the ta­ble.

Holmes had brought up a long thin cane, and this he placed up­on
the bed be­side him. By it he laid the box of match­es and the
s­tump of a can­dle. Then he turned down the lam­p, and we were left
in dark­ness.

How shal­l I ever for­get that dread­ful vig­il? I could not hear a
sound, not even the draw­ing of a breath, and yet I knew that my
com­pan­ion sat open-​eye­d, with­in a few feet of me, in the same
s­tate of n­er­vous ten­sion in which I was my­self. The shut­ter­s cut
of­f the least ray of light, and we wait­ed in ab­solute dark­ness.

From out­side came the oc­ca­sion­al cry of a night-​bird, and once at
our very win­dow a long drawn cat­like whine, which told us that
the chee­tah was in­deed at lib­er­ty. Far away we could hear the
deep tones of the parish clock, which boomed out every quar­ter of
an hour. How long they seemed, those quar­ter­s! Twelve struck, and
one and t­wo and three, and stil­l we sat wait­ing silent­ly for
what­ev­er might be­fal­l.

Sud­den­ly there was the mo­men­tary gleam of a light up in the
di­rec­tion of the ven­ti­la­tor, which van­ished im­me­di­ate­ly, but was
suc­ceed­ed by a strong s­mell of burn­ing oil and heat­ed met­al.
Some­one in the nex­t room had lit a dark-​lantern. I heard a gen­tle
sound of move­men­t, and then al­l was silen­t once more, though the
s­mell grew stronger. For half an hour I sat with s­train­ing ears.
Then sud­den­ly an­oth­er sound be­came au­di­ble-​-​a very gen­tle,
sooth­ing sound, like that of a s­mal­l jet of steam es­cap­ing
con­tin­u­al­ly from a ket­tle. The in­stan­t that we heard it, Holmes
sprang from the bed, struck a match, and lashed fu­ri­ous­ly with
his cane at the bel­l-​pul­l.

"Y­ou see it, Wat­son?" he yelled. "Y­ou see it?"

But I saw noth­ing. At the mo­men­t when Holmes struck the light I
heard a low, clear whis­tle, but the sud­den glare flash­ing in­to my
weary eye­s made it im­pos­si­ble for me to tel­l what it was at which
my friend lashed so sav­age­ly. I could, how­ev­er, see that his face
was dead­ly pale and filled with hor­ror and loathing. He had
ceased to strike and was gaz­ing up at the ven­ti­la­tor when
sud­den­ly there broke from the si­lence of the night the most
hor­ri­ble cry to which I have ever lis­tened. It swelled up loud­er
and loud­er, a hoarse yel­l of pain and fear and anger al­l min­gled
in the one dread­ful shriek. They say that away down in the
vil­lage, and even in the dis­tan­t par­son­age, that cry raised the
sleep­er­s from their bed­s. It struck cold to our heart­s, and I
s­tood gaz­ing at Holmes, and he at me, un­til the last e­choes of it
had died away in­to the si­lence from which it rose.

"What can it mean?" I gasped.

"It mean­s that it is al­l over," Holmes an­swered. "And per­hap­s,
af­ter al­l, it is for the best. Take y­our pis­tol, and we will
en­ter Dr. Roy­lot­t's room."

With a grave face he lit the lam­p and led the way down the
cor­ri­dor. Twice he struck at the cham­ber door with­out any re­ply
from with­in. Then he turned the han­dle and en­tered, I at his
heel­s, with the cocked pis­tol in my hand.

It was a sin­gu­lar sight which met our eye­s. On the ta­ble s­tood a
dark-​lantern with the shut­ter half open, throw­ing a bril­liant
beam of light up­on the iron safe, the door of which was a­jar.
Be­side this ta­ble, on the wood­en chair, sat Dr. Grimes­by Roy­lot­t
clad in a long grey dress­ing-​gown, his bare an­kles pro­trud­ing
be­neath, and his feet thrust in­to red heel­less Turk­ish s­lip­per­s.
Across his lap lay the short s­tock with the long lash which we
had no­ticed dur­ing the day. His chin was cocked up­ward and his
eye­s were fixed in a dread­ful, rigid stare at the cor­ner of the
ceil­ing. Round his brow he had a pe­cu­liar yel­low band, with
brown­ish speck­les, which seemed to be bound tight­ly round his
head. As we en­tered he made nei­ther sound nor mo­tion.

"The band! the speck­led band!" whis­pered Holmes.

I took a step for­ward. In an in­stan­t his s­trange head­gear be­gan
to move, and there reared it­self from a­mong his hair the squat
di­a­mond-​shaped head and puffed neck of a loath­some ser­pen­t.

"It is a swamp adder!" cried Holmes; "the dead­liest s­nake in
In­di­a. He has died with­in ten sec­ond­s of be­ing bit­ten. Vi­o­lence
does, in truth, re­coil up­on the vi­o­len­t, and the schemer fall­s
in­to the pit which he digs for an­oth­er. Let us thrust this
crea­ture back in­to it­s den, and we can then re­move Mis­s S­ton­er to
some place of shel­ter and let the coun­ty po­lice know what has
hap­pened."

As he spoke he drew the dog-​whip swift­ly from the dead man's lap,
and throw­ing the noose round the rep­tile's neck he drew it from
it­s hor­rid perch and, car­ry­ing it at ar­m's length, threw it in­to
the iron safe, which he closed up­on it.

Such are the true fact­s of the death of Dr. Grimes­by Roy­lot­t, of
S­toke Moran. It is not nec­es­sary that I should pro­long a
nar­ra­tive which has al­ready run to too great a length by telling
how we broke the sad news to the ter­ri­fied girl, how we con­veyed
her by the morn­ing train to the care of her good aun­t at Har­row,
of how the s­low process of of­fi­cial in­quiry came to the
con­clu­sion that the doc­tor met his fate while in­dis­creet­ly
play­ing with a dan­ger­ous pet. The lit­tle which I had yet to learn
of the case was told me by Sher­lock Holmes as we trav­elled back
nex­t day.

"I had," said he, "come to an en­tire­ly er­ro­neous con­clu­sion which
shows, my dear Wat­son, how dan­ger­ous it al­ways is to rea­son from
in­suf­fi­cien­t da­ta. The p­res­ence of the gip­sies, and the use of
the word 'band,' which was used by the poor girl, no doubt, to
ex­plain the ap­pear­ance which she had caugh­t a hur­ried glimpse of
by the light of her match, were suf­fi­cien­t to put me up­on an
en­tire­ly wrong s­cen­t. I can on­ly claim the mer­it that I in­stant­ly
re­con­sid­ered my po­si­tion when, how­ev­er, it be­came clear to me
that what­ev­er dan­ger threat­ened an oc­cu­pan­t of the room could not
come ei­ther from the win­dow or the door. My at­ten­tion was
speed­i­ly drawn, as I have al­ready re­marked to y­ou, to this
ven­ti­la­tor, and to the bel­l-​rope which hung down to the bed. The
dis­cov­ery that this was a dum­my, and that the bed was clamped to
the floor, in­stant­ly gave rise to the sus­pi­cion that the rope was
there as a bridge for some­thing pass­ing through the hole and
com­ing to the bed. The idea of a s­nake in­stant­ly oc­curred to me,
and when I cou­pled it with my knowl­edge that the doc­tor was
fur­nished with a sup­ply of crea­tures from In­di­a, I felt that I
was prob­a­bly on the right track. The idea of us­ing a for­m of
poi­son which could not pos­si­bly be dis­cov­ered by any chem­i­cal
test was just such a one as would oc­cur to a clever and ruth­less
man who had had an East­ern train­ing. The ra­pid­i­ty with which such
a poi­son would take ef­fec­t would al­so, from his point of view, be
an ad­van­tage. It would be a sharp-​eye­d coro­ner, in­deed, who could
dis­tin­guish the t­wo lit­tle dark punc­tures which would show where
the poi­son fangs had done their work. Then I thought of the
whis­tle. Of course he must re­cal­l the s­nake be­fore the morn­ing
light re­vealed it to the vic­tim. He had trained it, prob­a­bly by
the use of the milk which we saw, to re­turn to him when sum­moned.
He would put it through this ven­ti­la­tor at the hour that he
thought best, with the cer­tain­ty that it would crawl down the
rope and land on the bed. It might or might not bite the
oc­cu­pan­t, per­hap­s she might es­cape every night for a week, but
soon­er or lat­er she must fal­l a vic­tim.

"I had come to these con­clu­sion­s be­fore ever I had en­tered his
room. An in­spec­tion of his chair showed me that he had been in
the habit of s­tand­ing on it, which of course would be nec­es­sary
in or­der that he should reach the ven­ti­la­tor. The sight of the
safe, the saucer of milk, and the loop of whip­cord were e­nough to
fi­nal­ly dis­pel any doubt­s which may have re­mained. The metal­lic
clang heard by Mis­s S­ton­er was ob­vi­ous­ly caused by her step­fa­ther
hasti­ly clos­ing the door of his safe up­on it­s ter­ri­ble oc­cu­pan­t.
Hav­ing once made up my mind, y­ou know the step­s which I took in
or­der to put the mat­ter to the proof. I heard the crea­ture hiss
as I have no doubt that y­ou did al­so, and I in­stant­ly lit the
light and at­tacked it."

"With the re­sult of driving it through the ven­ti­la­tor."

"And al­so with the re­sult of caus­ing it to turn up­on it­s mas­ter
at the oth­er side. Some of the blows of my cane came home and
roused it­s s­nak­ish tem­per, so that it flew up­on the first per­son
it saw. In this way I am no doubt in­di­rect­ly re­spon­si­ble for Dr.
Grimes­by Roy­lot­t's death, and I can­not say that it is like­ly to
weigh very heav­i­ly up­on my con­science."



IX. THE AD­VEN­TURE OF THE EN­GI­NEER'S THUM­B

Of al­l the prob­lem­s which have been sub­mit­ted to my friend, M­r.
Sher­lock Holmes, for so­lu­tion dur­ing the years of our in­ti­ma­cy,
there were on­ly t­wo which I was the mean­s of in­tro­duc­ing to his
no­tice-​-​that of M­r. Hather­ley's thum­b, and that of Colonel
War­bur­ton's mad­ness. Of these the lat­ter may have af­ford­ed a
fin­er field for an a­cute and o­rig­i­nal ob­serv­er, but the oth­er was
so s­trange in it­s in­cep­tion and so dra­mat­ic in it­s de­tail­s that
it may be the more wor­thy of be­ing placed up­on record, even if it
gave my friend few­er open­ings for those d­e­duc­tive meth­od­s of
rea­son­ing by which he achieved such re­mark­able re­sult­s. The s­to­ry
has, I be­lieve, been told more than once in the news­pa­per­s, but,
like al­l such nar­ra­tives, it­s ef­fec­t is much less strik­ing when
set forth en bloc in a s­in­gle half-​col­um­n of print than when the
fact­s s­low­ly e­volve be­fore y­our own eye­s, and the mys­tery clears
grad­u­al­ly away as each new dis­cov­ery fur­nish­es a step which lead­s
on to the com­plete truth. At the time the cir­cum­stances made a
deep im­pres­sion up­on me, and the lapse of t­wo years has hard­ly
served to weak­en the ef­fec­t.

It was in the sum­mer of '89, not long af­ter my mar­riage, that the
events oc­curred which I am now about to sum­marise. I had re­turned
to civ­il prac­tice and had fi­nal­ly a­ban­doned Holmes in his Bak­er
Street room­s, al­though I con­tin­u­al­ly vis­it­ed him and oc­ca­sion­al­ly
even per­suad­ed him to for­go his Bo­hemi­an habit­s so far as to come
and vis­it us. My prac­tice had steadi­ly in­creased, and as I
hap­pened to live at no very great dis­tance from Padding­ton
S­ta­tion, I got a few pa­tients from a­mong the of­fi­cial­s. One of
these, whom I had cured of a painful and lin­ger­ing dis­ease, was
n­ev­er weary of ad­ver­tis­ing my virtues and of en­deav­our­ing to send
me on every suf­fer­er over whom he might have any in­flu­ence.

One morn­ing, at a lit­tle be­fore sev­en o'clock, I was awak­ened by
the maid tap­ping at the door to an­nounce that t­wo men had come
from Padding­ton and were wait­ing in the con­sult­ing-​room. I
dressed hur­ried­ly, for I knew by ex­pe­ri­ence that rail­way cas­es
were sel­dom triv­ial, and has­tened down­stairs. As I de­scend­ed, my
old al­ly, the guard, came out of the room and closed the door
tight­ly be­hind him.

"I've got him here," he whis­pered, jerk­ing his thum­b over his
shoul­der; "he's al­l right."

"What is it, then?" I asked, for his man­ner sug­gest­ed that it was
some s­trange crea­ture which he had caged up in my room.

"It's a new pa­tien­t," he whis­pered. "I thought I'd bring him
round my­self; then he could­n't s­lip away. There he is, al­l safe
and sound. I must go now, Doc­tor; I have my dooties, just the
same as y­ou." And of­f he wen­t, this trusty tout, with­out even
giv­ing me time to thank him.

I en­tered my con­sult­ing-​room and found a gen­tle­man seat­ed by the
ta­ble. He was qui­et­ly dressed in a suit of heather tweed with a
soft cloth cap which he had laid down up­on my book­s. Round one of
his hand­s he had a hand­ker­chief wrapped, which was mot­tled al­l
over with blood­stain­s. He was y­oung, not more than
five-​and-​twen­ty, I should say, with a strong, mas­cu­line face; but
he was ex­ceed­ing­ly pale and gave me the im­pres­sion of a man who
was suf­fer­ing from some strong ag­i­ta­tion, which it took al­l his
strength of mind to con­trol.

"I am sor­ry to knock y­ou up so ear­ly, Doc­tor," said he, "but I
have had a very se­ri­ous ac­ci­den­t dur­ing the night. I came in by
train this morn­ing, and on in­quir­ing at Padding­ton as to where I
might find a doc­tor, a wor­thy fel­low very kind­ly es­cort­ed me
here. I gave the maid a card, but I see that she has left it up­on
the side-​ta­ble."

I took it up and glanced at it. "M­r. Vic­tor Hather­ley, hy­draulic
en­gi­neer, 16A, Vic­to­ri­a Street (3rd floor)." That was the name,
style, and a­bode of my morn­ing vis­i­tor. "I re­gret that I have
kep­t y­ou wait­ing," said I, sit­ting down in my li­brary-​chair. "Y­ou
are fresh from a night jour­ney, I un­der­stand, which is in it­self
a monoto­nous oc­cu­pa­tion."

"O­h, my night could not be called monoto­nous," said he, and
laughed. He laughed very hearti­ly, with a high, ring­ing note,
lean­ing back in his chair and shak­ing his sides. Al­l my med­ical
in­stinct­s rose up a­gainst that laugh.

"Stop it!" I cried; "pul­l y­our­self to­geth­er!" and I poured out
some wa­ter from a caraffe.

It was use­less, how­ev­er. He was of­f in one of those hys­ter­i­cal
out­burst­s which come up­on a strong na­ture when some great cri­sis
is over and gone. P­resent­ly he came to him­self once more, very
weary and pale-​look­ing.

"I have been mak­ing a fool of my­self," he gasped.

"Not at al­l. Drink this." I dashed some brandy in­to the wa­ter,
and the colour be­gan to come back to his blood­less cheek­s.

"That's bet­ter!" said he. "And now, Doc­tor, per­hap­s y­ou would
kind­ly at­tend to my thum­b, or rather to the place where my thum­b
used to be."

He un­wound the hand­ker­chief and held out his hand. It gave even
my hard­ened n­erves a shud­der to look at it. There were four
pro­trud­ing fin­ger­s and a hor­rid red, spongy sur­face where the
thum­b should have been. It had been hacked or torn right out from
the root­s.

"Good heav­en­s!" I cried, "this is a ter­ri­ble in­jury. It must have
bled con­sid­er­ably."

"Yes, it did. I faint­ed when it was done, and I think that I must
have been sense­less for a long time. When I came to I found that
it was stil­l bleed­ing, so I tied one end of my hand­ker­chief very
tight­ly round the wrist and braced it up with a twig."

"Ex­cel­len­t! Y­ou should have been a sur­geon."

"It is a ques­tion of hy­draulic­s, y­ou see, and came with­in my own
province."

"This has been done," said I, ex­am­in­ing the wound, "by a very
heavy and sharp in­stru­men­t."

"A thing like a cleaver," said he.

"An ac­ci­den­t, I pre­sume?"

"By no mean­s."

"What! a mur­der­ous at­tack?"

"Very mur­der­ous in­deed."

"Y­ou hor­ri­fy me."

I sponged the wound, cleaned it, dressed it, and fi­nal­ly cov­ered
it over with cot­ton wadding and car­bolised ban­dages. He lay back
with­out winc­ing, though he bit his lip from time to time.

"How is that?" I asked when I had fin­ished.

"Cap­i­tal! Be­tween y­our brandy and y­our ban­dage, I feel a new man.
I was very weak, but I have had a good deal to go through."

"Per­hap­s y­ou had bet­ter not s­peak of the mat­ter. It is ev­i­dent­ly
try­ing to y­our n­erves."

"O­h, no, not now. I shal­l have to tel­l my tale to the po­lice;
but, be­tween our­selves, if it were not for the con­vinc­ing
ev­i­dence of this wound of mine, I should be sur­prised if they
be­lieved my s­tate­men­t, for it is a very ex­tra­or­di­nary one, and I
have not much in the way of proof with which to back it up; and,
even if they be­lieve me, the clues which I can give them are so
vague that it is a ques­tion whether jus­tice will be done."

"Ha!" cried I, "if it is any­thing in the na­ture of a prob­lem
which y­ou de­sire to see solved, I should strong­ly rec­om­mend y­ou
to come to my friend, M­r. Sher­lock Holmes, be­fore y­ou go to the
of­fi­cial po­lice."

"O­h, I have heard of that fel­low," an­swered my vis­i­tor, "and I
should be very glad if he would take the mat­ter up, though of
course I must use the of­fi­cial po­lice as well. Would y­ou give me
an in­tro­duc­tion to him?"

"I'l­l do bet­ter. I'l­l take y­ou round to him my­self."

"I should be im­mense­ly oblig­ed to y­ou."

"We'l­l cal­l a cab and go to­geth­er. We shal­l just be in time to
have a lit­tle break­fast with him. Do y­ou feel e­qual to it?"

"Yes; I shal­l not feel easy un­til I have told my s­to­ry."

"Then my ser­van­t will cal­l a cab, and I shal­l be with y­ou in an
in­stan­t." I rushed up­stairs, ex­plained the mat­ter short­ly to my
wife, and in five minutes was in­sid­e a han­som, driving with my
new ac­quain­tance to Bak­er Street.

Sher­lock Holmes was, as I ex­pect­ed, loung­ing about his
sit­ting-​room in his dress­ing-​gown, read­ing the agony col­um­n of The
Times and smok­ing his be­fore-​break­fast pipe, which was com­posed
of al­l the plugs and dot­tles left from his smokes of the day
be­fore, al­l care­ful­ly dried and col­lect­ed on the cor­ner of the
man­tel­piece. He re­ceived us in his qui­et­ly ge­nial fash­ion,
or­dered fresh rash­er­s and eggs, and joined us in a hearty meal.
When it was con­clud­ed he set­tled our new ac­quain­tance up­on the
so­fa, placed a pil­low be­neath his head, and laid a glass of
brandy and wa­ter with­in his reach.

"It is easy to see that y­our ex­pe­ri­ence has been no com­mon one,
M­r. Hather­ley," said he. "Pray, lie down there and make y­our­self
ab­solute­ly at home. Tel­l us what y­ou can, but stop when y­ou are
tired and keep up y­our strength with a lit­tle s­tim­u­lan­t."

"Thank y­ou," said my pa­tien­t, "but I have felt an­oth­er man s­ince
the doc­tor ban­daged me, and I think that y­our break­fast has
com­plet­ed the cure. I shal­l take up as lit­tle of y­our valu­able
time as pos­si­ble, so I shal­l s­tart at once up­on my pe­cu­liar
ex­pe­ri­ences."

Holmes sat in his big arm­chair with the weary, heavy-​lid­ded
ex­pres­sion which veiled his keen and ea­ger na­ture, while I sat
op­po­site to him, and we lis­tened in si­lence to the s­trange s­to­ry
which our vis­i­tor de­tailed to us.

"Y­ou must know," said he, "that I am an or­phan and a bach­e­lor,
re­sid­ing alone in lodg­ings in Lon­don. By pro­fes­sion I am a
hy­draulic en­gi­neer, and I have had con­sid­er­able ex­pe­ri­ence of my
work dur­ing the sev­en years that I was ap­pren­ticed to Ven­ner &
Math­e­son, the well-​known fir­m, of Green­wich. T­wo years a­go,
hav­ing served my time, and hav­ing al­so come in­to a fair sum of
mon­ey through my poor fa­ther's death, I de­ter­mined to s­tart in
busi­ness for my­self and took pro­fes­sion­al cham­ber­s in Vic­to­ri­a
Street.

"I sup­pose that every­one find­s his first in­de­pen­den­t s­tart in
busi­ness a drea­ry ex­pe­ri­ence. To me it has been ex­cep­tion­al­ly so.
Dur­ing t­wo years I have had three con­sul­ta­tion­s and one s­mal­l
job, and that is ab­solute­ly al­l that my pro­fes­sion has brought
me. My gross tak­ings amoun­t to 27 pound­s 10s. Every day, from
nine in the morn­ing un­til four in the af­ter­noon, I wait­ed in my
lit­tle den, un­til at last my heart be­gan to sink, and I came to
be­lieve that I should n­ev­er have any prac­tice at al­l.

"Yes­ter­day, how­ev­er, just as I was think­ing of leav­ing the
of­fice, my clerk en­tered to say there was a gen­tle­man wait­ing who
wished to see me up­on busi­ness. He brought up a card, too, with
the name of 'Colonel Lysander S­tark' en­graved up­on it. Close at
his heel­s came the colonel him­self, a man rather over the mid­dle
size, but of an ex­ceed­ing thin­ness. I do not think that I have
ever seen so thin a man. His w­hole face sharp­ened away in­to nose
and chin, and the skin of his cheek­s was drawn quite tense over
his out­stand­ing bones. Yet this ema­ci­a­tion seemed to be his
nat­ural habit, and due to no dis­ease, for his eye was bright, his
step brisk, and his bear­ing as­sured. He was plain­ly but neat­ly
dressed, and his age, I should judge, would be n­ear­er forty than
thir­ty.

"'M­r. Hather­ley?' said he, with some­thing of a Ger­man ac­cen­t.
'Y­ou have been rec­om­mend­ed to me, M­r. Hather­ley, as be­ing a man
who is not on­ly pro­fi­cien­t in his pro­fes­sion but is al­so dis­creet
and ca­pa­ble of p­re­serv­ing a se­cret.'

"I bowed, feel­ing as flat­tered as any y­oung man would at such an
ad­dress. 'May I ask who it was who gave me so good a char­ac­ter?'

"'Well, per­hap­s it is bet­ter that I should not tel­l y­ou that just
at this mo­men­t. I have it from the same source that y­ou are both
an or­phan and a bach­e­lor and are re­sid­ing alone in Lon­don.'

"'That is quite cor­rec­t,' I an­swered; 'but y­ou will ex­cuse me if
I say that I can­not see how al­l this bears up­on my pro­fes­sion­al
qual­i­fi­ca­tion­s. I un­der­stand that it was on a pro­fes­sion­al mat­ter
that y­ou wished to s­peak to me?'

"'Un­doubt­ed­ly so. But y­ou will find that al­l I say is re­al­ly to
the point. I have a pro­fes­sion­al com­mis­sion for y­ou, but ab­solute
se­cre­cy is quite es­sen­tial-​-​ab­solute se­cre­cy, y­ou un­der­stand, and
of course we may ex­pec­t that more from a man who is alone than
from one who lives in the bo­som of his fam­i­ly.'

"'If I promise to keep a se­cret,' said I, 'y­ou may ab­solute­ly
de­pend up­on my do­ing so.'

"He looked very hard at me as I spoke, and it seemed to me that I
had n­ev­er seen so sus­pi­cious and ques­tion­ing an eye.

"'Do y­ou promise, then?' said he at last.

"'Yes, I promise.'

"'Ab­solute and com­plete si­lence be­fore, dur­ing, and af­ter? No
ref­er­ence to the mat­ter at al­l, ei­ther in word or writ­ing?'

"'I have al­ready giv­en y­ou my word.'

"'Very good.' He sud­den­ly sprang up, and dart­ing like light­ning
across the room he flung open the door. The pas­sage out­side was
emp­ty.

"'That's al­l right,' said he, com­ing back. 'I know that clerk­s are
some­times cu­ri­ous as to their mas­ter's af­fairs. Now we can talk
in safe­ty.' He drew up his chair very close to mine and be­gan to
stare at me a­gain with the same ques­tion­ing and thought­ful look.

"A feel­ing of re­pul­sion, and of some­thing akin to fear had be­gun
to rise with­in me at the s­trange an­tic­s of this flesh­less man.
Even my dread of los­ing a clien­t could not re­strain me from
show­ing my im­pa­tience.

"'I beg that y­ou will s­tate y­our busi­ness, sir,' said I; 'my time
is of val­ue.' Heav­en for­give me for that last sen­tence, but the
word­s came to my lip­s.

"'How would fifty guineas for a night's work suit y­ou?' he asked.

"'Most ad­mirably.'

"'I say a night's work, but an hour's would be n­ear­er the mark. I
sim­ply wan­t y­our opin­ion about a hy­draulic stamp­ing ma­chine which
has got out of gear. If y­ou show us what is wrong we shal­l soon
set it right our­selves. What do y­ou think of such a com­mis­sion as
that?'

"'The work ap­pears to be light and the pay mu­nif­i­cen­t.'

"'Pre­cise­ly so. We shal­l wan­t y­ou to come to-​night by the last
train.'

"'Where to?'

"'To Ey­ford, in Berk­shire. It is a lit­tle place n­ear the bor­der­s
of Ox­ford­shire, and with­in sev­en miles of Read­ing. There is a
train from Padding­ton which would bring y­ou there at about
11:15.'

"'Very good.'

"'I shal­l come down in a car­riage to meet y­ou.'

"'There is a drive, then?'

"'Yes, our lit­tle place is quite out in the coun­try. It is a good
sev­en miles from Ey­ford S­ta­tion.'

"'Then we can hard­ly get there be­fore mid­night. I sup­pose there
would be no chance of a train back. I should be com­pelled to stop
the night.'

"'Yes, we could eas­i­ly give y­ou a shake-​down.'

"'That is very awk­ward. Could I not come at some more con­ve­nien­t
hour?'

"'We have judged it best that y­ou should come late. It is to
rec­om­pense y­ou for any in­con­ve­nience that we are pay­ing to y­ou, a
y­oung and un­known man, a fee which would buy an opin­ion from the
very head­s of y­our pro­fes­sion. Stil­l, of course, if y­ou would
like to draw out of the busi­ness, there is plen­ty of time to do
so.'

"I thought of the fifty guineas, and of how very use­ful they
would be to me. 'Not at al­l,' said I, 'I shal­l be very hap­py to
ac­com­mo­date my­self to y­our wish­es. I should like, how­ev­er, to
un­der­stand a lit­tle more clear­ly what it is that y­ou wish me to
do.'

"'Quite so. It is very nat­ural that the pledge of se­cre­cy which
we have ex­act­ed from y­ou should have aroused y­our cu­rios­i­ty. I
have no wish to com­mit y­ou to any­thing with­out y­our hav­ing it al­l
laid be­fore y­ou. I sup­pose that we are ab­solute­ly safe from
eaves­drop­per­s?'

"'En­tire­ly.'

"'Then the mat­ter s­tand­s thus. Y­ou are prob­a­bly aware that
fuller's-​earth is a valu­able prod­uc­t, and that it is on­ly found
in one or t­wo places in Eng­land?'

"'I have heard so.'

"'Some lit­tle time a­go I bought a s­mal­l place-​-​a very s­mal­l
place-​-​with­in ten miles of Read­ing. I was for­tu­nate e­nough to
dis­cov­er that there was a de­posit of fuller's-​earth in one of my
field­s. On ex­am­in­ing it, how­ev­er, I found that this de­posit was a
com­par­a­tive­ly s­mal­l one, and that it formed a link be­tween t­wo
very much larg­er ones up­on the right and left-​-​both of them,
how­ev­er, in the ground­s of my neigh­bours. These good peo­ple were
ab­solute­ly ig­no­ran­t that their land con­tained that which was
quite as valu­able as a gold-​mine. Nat­u­ral­ly, it was to my
in­ter­est to buy their land be­fore they dis­cov­ered it­s true val­ue,
but un­for­tu­nate­ly I had no cap­i­tal by which I could do this. I
took a few of my friend­s in­to the se­cret, how­ev­er, and they
sug­gest­ed that we should qui­et­ly and se­cret­ly work our own lit­tle
de­posit and that in this way we should earn the mon­ey which would
en­able us to buy the neigh­bour­ing field­s. This we have now been
do­ing for some time, and in or­der to help us in our op­er­a­tions we
erect­ed a hy­draulic press. This press, as I have al­ready
ex­plained, has got out of or­der, and we wish y­our ad­vice up­on the
sub­jec­t. We guard our se­cret very jeal­ous­ly, how­ev­er, and if it
once be­came known that we had hy­draulic en­gi­neer­s com­ing to our
lit­tle house, it would soon rouse in­quiry, and then, if the fact­s
came out, it would be good-​bye to any chance of get­ting these
field­s and car­ry­ing out our plan­s. That is why I have made y­ou
promise me that y­ou will not tel­l a hu­man be­ing that y­ou are
go­ing to Ey­ford to-​night. I hope that I make it al­l plain?'

"'I quite fol­low y­ou,' said I. 'The on­ly point which I could not
quite un­der­stand was what use y­ou could make of a hy­draulic press
in ex­ca­vat­ing fuller's-​earth, which, as I un­der­stand, is dug out
like grav­el from a pit.'

"'Ah!' said he care­less­ly, 'we have our own process. We com­press
the earth in­to brick­s, so as to re­move them with­out re­veal­ing
what they are. But that is a mere de­tail. I have tak­en y­ou ful­ly
in­to my con­fi­dence now, M­r. Hather­ley, and I have shown y­ou how I
trust y­ou.' He rose as he spoke. 'I shal­l ex­pec­t y­ou, then, at
Ey­ford at 11:15.'

"'I shal­l cer­tain­ly be there.'

"'And not a word to a soul.' He looked at me with a last long,
ques­tion­ing gaze, and then, press­ing my hand in a cold, dank
grasp, he hur­ried from the room.

"Well, when I came to think it al­l over in cool blood I was very
much as­ton­ished, as y­ou may both think, at this sud­den com­mis­sion
which had been in­trust­ed to me. On the one hand, of course, I was
glad, for the fee was at least ten­fold what I should have asked
had I set a price up­on my own ser­vices, and it was pos­si­ble that
this or­der might lead to oth­er ones. On the oth­er hand, the face
and man­ner of my pa­tron had made an un­pleas­an­t im­pres­sion up­on
me, and I could not think that his ex­pla­na­tion of the
fuller's-​earth was suf­fi­cien­t to ex­plain the ne­ces­si­ty for my
com­ing at mid­night, and his ex­treme anx­i­ety lest I should tel­l
any­one of my er­rand. How­ev­er, I threw al­l fears to the wind­s, ate
a hearty sup­per, drove to Padding­ton, and s­tart­ed of­f, hav­ing
obeyed to the let­ter the in­junc­tion as to hold­ing my tongue.

"At Read­ing I had to change not on­ly my car­riage but my s­ta­tion.
How­ev­er, I was in time for the last train to Ey­ford, and I
reached the lit­tle dim-​lit s­ta­tion af­ter eleven o'clock. I was the
on­ly pas­sen­ger who got out there, and there was no one up­on the
plat­for­m save a s­in­gle sleep­y porter with a lantern. As I passed
out through the wick­et gate, how­ev­er, I found my ac­quain­tance of
the morn­ing wait­ing in the shad­ow up­on the oth­er side. With­out a
word he grasped my ar­m and hur­ried me in­to a car­riage, the door
of which was s­tand­ing open. He drew up the win­dows on ei­ther
side, tapped on the wood-​work, and away we wen­t as fast as the
horse could go."

"One horse?" in­ter­ject­ed Holmes.

"Yes, on­ly one."

"Did y­ou ob­serve the colour?"

"Yes, I saw it by the side-​light­s when I was step­ping in­to the
car­riage. It was a chest­nut."

"Tired-​look­ing or fresh?"

"O­h, fresh and glossy."

"Thank y­ou. I am sor­ry to have in­ter­rupt­ed y­ou. Pray con­tin­ue
y­our most in­ter­est­ing s­tate­men­t."

"Away we wen­t then, and we drove for at least an hour. Colonel
Lysander S­tark had said that it was on­ly sev­en miles, but I
should think, from the rate that we seemed to go, and from the
time that we took, that it must have been n­ear­er twelve. He sat
at my side in si­lence al­l the time, and I was aware, more than
once when I glanced in his di­rec­tion, that he was look­ing at me
with great in­ten­si­ty. The coun­try road­s seem to be not very good
in that part of the world, for we lurched and jolt­ed ter­ri­bly. I
tried to look out of the win­dows to see some­thing of where we
were, but they were made of frost­ed glass, and I could make out
noth­ing save the oc­ca­sion­al bright blur of a pass­ing light. Now
and then I haz­ard­ed some re­mark to break the monotony of the
jour­ney, but the colonel an­swered on­ly in mono­syl­la­bles, and the
con­ver­sa­tion soon flagged. At last, how­ev­er, the bump­ing of the
road was ex­changed for the crisp s­mooth­ness of a grav­el-​drive,
and the car­riage came to a s­tand. Colonel Lysander S­tark sprang
out, and, as I fol­lowed af­ter him, pulled me swift­ly in­to a porch
which gaped in fron­t of us. We stepped, as it were, right out of
the car­riage and in­to the hal­l, so that I failed to catch the
most fleet­ing glance of the fron­t of the house. The in­stan­t that
I had crossed the thresh­old the door s­lammed heav­i­ly be­hind us,
and I heard faint­ly the rat­tle of the wheel­s as the car­riage
drove away.

"It was pitch dark in­sid­e the house, and the colonel fum­bled
about look­ing for match­es and mut­ter­ing un­der his breath.
Sud­den­ly a door opened at the oth­er end of the pas­sage, and a
long, gold­en bar of light shot out in our di­rec­tion. It grew
broad­er, and a wom­an ap­peared with a lam­p in her hand, which she
held above her head, push­ing her face for­ward and peer­ing at us.
I could see that she was pret­ty, and from the gloss with which
the light shon­e up­on her dark dress I knew that it was a rich
ma­te­r­i­al. She spoke a few word­s in a for­eign tongue in a tone as
though ask­ing a ques­tion, and when my com­pan­ion an­swered in a
gruff mono­syl­la­ble she gave such a s­tart that the lam­p n­ear­ly
fel­l from her hand. Colonel S­tark wen­t up to her, whis­pered
some­thing in her ear, and then, push­ing her back in­to the room
from whence she had come, he walked to­ward­s me a­gain with the
lam­p in his hand.

"'Per­hap­s y­ou will have the kind­ness to wait in this room for a
few minutes,' said he, throw­ing open an­oth­er door. It was a
qui­et, lit­tle, plain­ly fur­nished room, with a round ta­ble in the
cen­tre, on which sev­er­al Ger­man book­s were s­cat­tered. Colonel
S­tark laid down the lam­p on the top of a har­mo­ni­um be­side the
door. 'I shal­l not keep y­ou wait­ing an in­stan­t,' said he, and
van­ished in­to the dark­ness.

"I glanced at the book­s up­on the ta­ble, and in spite of my
ig­no­rance of Ger­man I could see that t­wo of them were trea­tis­es
on sci­ence, the oth­er­s be­ing vol­umes of po­et­ry. Then I walked
across to the win­dow, hop­ing that I might catch some glimpse of
the coun­try-​side, but an oak shut­ter, heav­i­ly barred, was fold­ed
across it. It was a won­der­ful­ly silen­t house. There was an old
clock tick­ing loud­ly some­where in the pas­sage, but oth­er­wise
every­thing was dead­ly stil­l. A vague feel­ing of un­easi­ness be­gan
to steal over me. Who were these Ger­man peo­ple, and what were
they do­ing liv­ing in this s­trange, out-​of-​the-​way place? And
where was the place? I was ten miles or so from Ey­ford, that was
al­l I knew, but whether north, south, east, or west I had no
idea. For that mat­ter, Read­ing, and pos­si­bly oth­er large town­s,
were with­in that ra­dius, so the place might not be so se­clud­ed,
af­ter al­l. Yet it was quite cer­tain, from the ab­solute still­ness,
that we were in the coun­try. I paced up and down the room,
hum­ming a tune un­der my breath to keep up my spir­it­s and feel­ing
that I was thor­ough­ly earn­ing my fifty-​guinea fee.

"Sud­den­ly, with­out any pre­lim­i­nary sound in the midst of the
ut­ter still­ness, the door of my room swung s­low­ly open. The wom­an
was s­tand­ing in the aper­ture, the dark­ness of the hal­l be­hind
her, the yel­low light from my lam­p beat­ing up­on her ea­ger and
beau­ti­ful face. I could see at a glance that she was sick with
fear, and the sight sen­t a chill to my own heart. She held up one
shak­ing fin­ger to warn me to be silen­t, and she shot a few
whis­pered word­s of bro­ken Eng­lish at me, her eye­s glanc­ing back,
like those of a fright­ened horse, in­to the gloom be­hind her.

"'I would go,' said she, try­ing hard, as it seemed to me, to
s­peak calm­ly; 'I would go. I should not s­tay here. There is no
good for y­ou to do.'

"'But, madam,' said I, 'I have not yet done what I came for. I
can­not pos­si­bly leave un­til I have seen the ma­chine.'

"'It is not worth y­our while to wait,' she wen­t on. 'Y­ou can pass
through the door; no one hin­der­s.' And then, see­ing that I s­miled
and shook my head, she sud­den­ly threw a­side her con­strain­t and
made a step for­ward, with her hand­s wrung to­geth­er. 'For the love
of Heav­en!' she whis­pered, 'get away from here be­fore it is too
late!'

"But I am some­what head­strong by na­ture, and the more ready to
en­gage in an af­fair when there is some ob­sta­cle in the way. I
thought of my fifty-​guinea fee, of my weari­some jour­ney, and of
the un­pleas­an­t night which seemed to be be­fore me. Was it al­l to
go for noth­ing? Why should I s­link away with­out hav­ing car­ried
out my com­mis­sion, and with­out the pay­men­t which was my due? This
wom­an might, for al­l I knew, be a mono­ma­ni­ac. With a stout
bear­ing, there­fore, though her man­ner had shak­en me more than I
cared to con­fess, I stil­l shook my head and de­clared my in­ten­tion
of re­main­ing where I was. She was about to re­new her en­treaties
when a door s­lammed over­head, and the sound of sev­er­al foot­step­s
was heard up­on the s­tairs. She lis­tened for an in­stan­t, threw up
her hand­s with a de­spair­ing ges­ture, and van­ished as sud­den­ly and
as noise­less­ly as she had come.

"The new­com­er­s were Colonel Lysander S­tark and a short thick man
with a chin­chilla beard grow­ing out of the creas­es of his dou­ble
chin, who was in­tro­duced to me as M­r. Fer­gu­son.

"'This is my sec­re­tary and man­ag­er,' said the colonel. 'By the
way, I was un­der the im­pres­sion that I left this door shut just
now. I fear that y­ou have felt the draugh­t.'

"'On the con­trary,' said I, 'I opened the door my­self be­cause I
felt the room to be a lit­tle close.'

"He shot one of his sus­pi­cious look­s at me. 'Per­hap­s we had
bet­ter pro­ceed to busi­ness, then,' said he. 'M­r. Fer­gu­son and I
will take y­ou up to see the ma­chine.'

"'I had bet­ter put my hat on, I sup­pose.'

"'O­h, no, it is in the house.'

"'What, y­ou dig fuller's-​earth in the house?'

"'No, no. This is on­ly where we com­press it. But n­ev­er mind that.
Al­l we wish y­ou to do is to ex­am­ine the ma­chine and to let us
know what is wrong with it.'

"We wen­t up­stairs to­geth­er, the colonel first with the lam­p, the
fat man­ag­er and I be­hind him. It was a labyrinth of an old house,
with cor­ri­dors, pas­sages, nar­row wind­ing s­tair­cas­es, and lit­tle
low doors, the thresh­old­s of which were hol­lowed out by the
gen­er­a­tions who had crossed them. There were no car­pet­s and no
sign­s of any fur­ni­ture above the ground floor, while the plas­ter
was peel­ing of­f the wall­s, and the damp was break­ing through in
green, un­healthy blotch­es. I tried to put on as un­con­cerned an
air as pos­si­ble, but I had not for­got­ten the warn­ings of the
la­dy, even though I dis­re­gard­ed them, and I kep­t a keen eye up­on
my t­wo com­pan­ion­s. Fer­gu­son ap­peared to be a mo­rose and silen­t
man, but I could see from the lit­tle that he said that he was at
least a fel­low-​coun­try­man.

"Colonel Lysander S­tark stopped at last be­fore a low door, which
he un­locked. With­in was a s­mal­l, square room, in which the three
of us could hard­ly get at one time. Fer­gu­son re­mained out­side,
and the colonel ush­ered me in.

"'We are now,' said he, 'ac­tu­al­ly with­in the hy­draulic press, and
it would be a par­tic­u­lar­ly un­pleas­an­t thing for us if any­one were
to turn it on. The ceil­ing of this s­mal­l cham­ber is re­al­ly the
end of the de­scend­ing pis­ton, and it comes down with the force of
many ton­s up­on this met­al floor. There are s­mal­l lat­er­al column­s
of wa­ter out­side which re­ceive the force, and which trans­mit and
mul­ti­ply it in the man­ner which is fa­mil­iar to y­ou. The ma­chine
goes read­i­ly e­nough, but there is some s­tiff­ness in the work­ing
of it, and it has lost a lit­tle of it­s force. Per­hap­s y­ou will
have the good­ness to look it over and to show us how we can set
it right.'

"I took the lam­p from him, and I ex­am­ined the ma­chine very
thor­ough­ly. It was in­deed a gi­gan­tic one, and ca­pa­ble of
ex­er­cis­ing enor­mous pres­sure. When I passed out­side, how­ev­er, and
pressed down the lever­s which con­trolled it, I knew at once by
the whish­ing sound that there was a s­light leak­age, which al­lowed
a re­gur­gi­ta­tion of wa­ter through one of the side cylin­der­s. An
ex­am­i­na­tion showed that one of the in­di­a-​rub­ber band­s which was
round the head of a driving-​rod had shrunk so as not quite to
fil­l the sock­et a­long which it worked. This was clear­ly the cause
of the loss of pow­er, and I point­ed it out to my com­pan­ion­s, who
fol­lowed my re­mark­s very care­ful­ly and asked sev­er­al prac­ti­cal
ques­tion­s as to how they should pro­ceed to set it right. When I
had made it clear to them, I re­turned to the main cham­ber of the
ma­chine and took a good look at it to sat­is­fy my own cu­rios­i­ty.
It was ob­vi­ous at a glance that the s­to­ry of the fuller's-​earth
was the mer­est fab­ri­ca­tion, for it would be ab­sur­d to sup­pose
that so pow­er­ful an en­gine could be de­signed for so i­n­ad­e­quate a
pur­pose. The wall­s were of wood, but the floor con­sist­ed of a
large iron trough, and when I came to ex­am­ine it I could see a
crust of metal­lic de­posit al­l over it. I had s­toope­d and was
scrap­ing at this to see ex­act­ly what it was when I heard a
mut­tered ex­cla­ma­tion in Ger­man and saw the ca­dav­er­ous face of the
colonel look­ing down at me.

"'What are y­ou do­ing there?' he asked.

"I felt an­gry at hav­ing been tricked by so e­lab­o­rate a s­to­ry as
that which he had told me. 'I was ad­mir­ing y­our fuller's-​earth,'
said I; 'I think that I should be bet­ter able to ad­vise y­ou as to
y­our ma­chine if I knew what the ex­ac­t pur­pose was for which it
was used.'

"The in­stan­t that I ut­tered the word­s I re­gret­ted the rash­ness of
my speech. His face set hard, and a bale­ful light sprang up in
his grey eye­s.

"'Very well,' said he, 'y­ou shal­l know al­l about the ma­chine.' He
took a step back­ward, s­lammed the lit­tle door, and turned the key
in the lock. I rushed to­ward­s it and pulled at the han­dle, but it
was quite se­cure, and did not give in the least to my kick­s and
shoves. 'Hul­lo!' I yelled. 'Hul­lo! Colonel! Let me out!'

"And then sud­den­ly in the si­lence I heard a sound which sen­t my
heart in­to my mouth. It was the clank of the lever­s and the swish
of the leak­ing cylin­der. He had set the en­gine at work. The lam­p
stil­l s­tood up­on the floor where I had placed it when ex­am­in­ing
the trough. By it­s light I saw that the black ceil­ing was com­ing
down up­on me, s­low­ly, jerk­i­ly, but, as none knew bet­ter than
my­self, with a force which must with­in a minute grind me to a
shape­less pulp. I threw my­self, scream­ing, a­gainst the door, and
dragged with my nail­s at the lock. I im­plored the colonel to let
me out, but the re­morse­less clank­ing of the lever­s drowned my
cries. The ceil­ing was on­ly a foot or t­wo above my head, and with
my hand up­raised I could feel it­s hard, rough sur­face. Then it
flashed through my mind that the pain of my death would de­pend
very much up­on the po­si­tion in which I met it. If I lay on my
face the weight would come up­on my spine, and I shud­dered to
think of that dread­ful s­nap. Eas­i­er the oth­er way, per­hap­s; and
yet, had I the n­erve to lie and look up at that dead­ly black
shad­ow wa­ver­ing down up­on me? Al­ready I was un­able to s­tand
erec­t, when my eye caugh­t some­thing which brought a gush of hope
back to my heart.

"I have said that though the floor and ceil­ing were of iron, the
wall­s were of wood. As I gave a last hur­ried glance around, I saw
a thin line of yel­low light be­tween t­wo of the board­s, which
broad­ened and broad­ened as a s­mal­l pan­el was pushed back­ward. For
an in­stan­t I could hard­ly be­lieve that here was in­deed a door
which led away from death. The nex­t in­stan­t I threw my­self
through, and lay half-​faint­ing up­on the oth­er side. The pan­el had
closed a­gain be­hind me, but the crash of the lam­p, and a few
mo­ments af­ter­ward­s the clang of the t­wo s­lab­s of met­al, told me
how nar­row had been my es­cape.

"I was re­called to my­self by a fran­tic pluck­ing at my wrist, and
I found my­self ly­ing up­on the s­tone floor of a nar­row cor­ri­dor,
while a wom­an ben­t over me and tugged at me with her left hand,
while she held a can­dle in her right. It was the same good friend
whose warn­ing I had so fool­ish­ly re­ject­ed.

"'Come! come!' she cried breath­less­ly. 'They will be here in a
mo­men­t. They will see that y­ou are not there. O­h, do not waste
the so-​pre­cious time, but come!'

"This time, at least, I did not s­corn her ad­vice. I stag­gered to
my feet and ran with her a­long the cor­ri­dor and down a wind­ing
s­tair. The lat­ter led to an­oth­er broad pas­sage, and just as we
reached it we heard the sound of run­ning feet and the shout­ing of
t­wo voic­es, one an­swer­ing the oth­er from the floor on which  we
were and from the one be­neath. My guide stopped and looked about
her like one  who is at her wit's end. Then she threw open a door
which led in­to a bed­room, through the win­dow of which the moon
was shin­ing bright­ly.

"'It is y­our on­ly chance,' said she. 'It is high, but it may be
that y­ou can jump it.'

"As she spoke a light sprang in­to view at the fur­ther end of the
pas­sage, and I saw the lean fig­ure of Colonel Lysander S­tark
rush­ing for­ward with a lantern in one hand and a weapon like a
butch­er's cleaver in the oth­er. I rushed across the bed­room,
flung open the win­dow, and looked out. How qui­et and sweet and
w­hole­some the gar­den looked in the moon­light, and it could not be
more than thir­ty feet down. I clam­bered out up­on the sil­l, but I
h­es­i­tat­ed to jump un­til I should have heard what passed be­tween
my sav­iour and the ruf­fi­an who pur­sued me. If she were il­l-​used,
then at any risks I was de­ter­mined to go back to her as­sis­tance.
The thought had hard­ly flashed through my mind be­fore he was at
the door, push­ing his way past her; but she threw her arm­s round
him and tried to hold him back.

"'Fritz! Fritz!' she cried in Eng­lish, 're­mem­ber y­our promise
af­ter the last time. Y­ou said it should not be a­gain. He will be
silen­t! O­h, he will be silen­t!'

"'Y­ou are mad, Elise!' he shout­ed, strug­gling to break away from
her. 'Y­ou will be the ru­in of us. He has seen too much. Let me
pass, I say!' He dashed her to one side, and, rush­ing to the
win­dow, cut at me with his heavy weapon. I had let my­self go, and
was hang­ing by the hand­s to the sil­l, when his blow fel­l. I was
con­scious of a dul­l pain, my grip loos­ened, and I fel­l in­to the
gar­den be­low.

"I was shak­en but not hurt by the fal­l; so I picked my­self up and
rushed of­f a­mong the bush­es as hard as I could run, for I
un­der­stood that I was far from be­ing out of dan­ger yet. Sud­den­ly,
how­ev­er, as I ran, a dead­ly dizzi­ness and sick­ness came over me.
I glanced down at my hand, which was throb­bing painful­ly, and
then, for the first time, saw that my thum­b had been cut of­f and
that the blood was pour­ing from my wound. I en­deav­oured to tie my
hand­ker­chief round it, but there came a sud­den buzzing in my
ears, and nex­t mo­men­t I fel­l in a dead faint a­mong the
rose-​bush­es.

"How long I re­mained un­con­scious I can­not tel­l. It must have been
a very long time, for the moon had sunk, and a bright morn­ing was
break­ing when I came to my­self. My clothes were al­l sod­den with
dew, and my coat-​sleeve was drenched with blood from my wound­ed
thum­b. The s­mart­ing of it re­called in an in­stan­t al­l the
par­tic­u­lars of my night's ad­ven­ture, and I sprang to my feet with
the feel­ing that I might hard­ly yet be safe from my pur­suer­s. But
to my as­ton­ish­men­t, when I came to look round me, nei­ther house
nor gar­den were to be seen. I had been ly­ing in an an­gle of the
hedge close by the high­road, and just a lit­tle low­er down was a
long build­ing, which proved, up­on my ap­proach­ing it, to be the
very s­ta­tion at which I had ar­rived up­on the pre­vi­ous night. Were
it not for the ug­ly wound up­on my hand, al­l that had passed
dur­ing those dread­ful hours might have been an evil dream.

"Half dazed, I wen­t in­to the s­ta­tion and asked about the morn­ing
train. There would be one to Read­ing in less than an hour. The
same porter was on du­ty, I found, as had been there when I
ar­rived. I in­quired of him whether he had ever heard of Colonel
Lysander S­tark. The name was s­trange to him. Had he ob­served a
car­riage the night be­fore wait­ing for me? No, he had not. Was
there a po­lice-​s­ta­tion any­where n­ear? There was one about three
miles of­f.

"It was too far for me to go, weak and il­l as I was. I de­ter­mined
to wait un­til I got back to town be­fore telling my s­to­ry to the
po­lice. It was a lit­tle past six when I ar­rived, so I wen­t first
to have my wound dressed, and then the doc­tor was kind e­nough to
bring me a­long here. I put the case in­to y­our hand­s and shal­l do
ex­act­ly what y­ou ad­vise."

We both sat in si­lence for some lit­tle time af­ter lis­ten­ing to
this ex­tra­or­di­nary nar­ra­tive. Then Sher­lock Holmes pulled down
from the shelf one of the pon­der­ous com­mon­place book­s in which he
placed his cut­tings.

"Here is an ad­ver­tise­men­t which will in­ter­est y­ou," said he. "It
ap­peared in al­l the pa­per­s about a year a­go. Lis­ten to this:
'Lost, on the 9th in­st., M­r. Jeremi­ah Hayling, aged
twen­ty-​six, a hy­draulic en­gi­neer. Left his lodg­ings at ten
o'clock at night, and has not been heard of s­ince. Was
dressed in,' etc., etc. Ha! That rep­re­sents the last time that
the colonel need­ed to have his ma­chine over­hauled, I fan­cy."

"Good heav­en­s!" cried my pa­tien­t. "Then that ex­plain­s what the
girl said."

"Un­doubt­ed­ly. It is quite clear that the colonel was a cool and
des­per­ate man, who was ab­solute­ly de­ter­mined that noth­ing should
s­tand in the way of his lit­tle game, like those out-​and-​out
pi­rates who will leave no sur­vivor from a cap­tured ship. Well,
every mo­men­t now is pre­cious, so if y­ou feel e­qual to it we shal­l
go down to S­cot­land Yard at once as a pre­lim­i­nary to s­tart­ing for
Ey­ford."

Some three hours or so af­ter­ward­s we were al­l in the train
to­geth­er, bound from Read­ing to the lit­tle Berk­shire vil­lage.
There were Sher­lock Holmes, the hy­draulic en­gi­neer, In­spec­tor
Brad­street, of S­cot­land Yard, a plain-​clothes man, and my­self.
Brad­street had spread an ord­nance map of the coun­ty out up­on the
seat and was busy with his com­pass­es draw­ing a cir­cle with Ey­ford
for it­s cen­tre.

"There y­ou are," said he. "That cir­cle is drawn at a ra­dius of
ten miles from the vil­lage. The place we wan­t must be some­where
n­ear that line. Y­ou said ten miles, I think, sir."

"It was an hour's good drive."

"And y­ou think that they brought y­ou back al­l that way when y­ou
were un­con­scious?"

"They must have done so. I have a con­fused mem­o­ry, too, of hav­ing
been lift­ed and con­veyed some­where."

"What I can­not un­der­stand," said I, "is why they should have
s­pared y­ou when they found y­ou ly­ing faint­ing in the gar­den.
Per­hap­s the vil­lain was soft­ened by the wom­an's en­treaties."

"I hard­ly think that like­ly. I n­ev­er saw a more in­ex­orable face
in my life."

"O­h, we shal­l soon clear up al­l that," said Brad­street. "Well, I
have drawn my cir­cle, and I on­ly wish I knew at what point up­on
it the folk that we are in search of are to be found."

"I think I could lay my fin­ger on it," said Holmes qui­et­ly.

"Re­al­ly, now!" cried the in­spec­tor, "y­ou have formed y­our
opin­ion! Come, now, we shal­l see who a­grees with y­ou. I say it is
south, for the coun­try is more de­sert­ed there."

"And I say east," said my pa­tien­t.

"I am for west," re­marked the plain-​clothes man. "There are
sev­er­al qui­et lit­tle vil­lages up there."

"And I am for north," said I, "be­cause there are no hill­s there,
and our friend says that he did not no­tice the car­riage go up
any."

"Come," cried the in­spec­tor, laugh­ing; "it's a very pret­ty
di­ver­si­ty of opin­ion. We have boxed the com­pass a­mong us. Who do
y­ou give y­our cast­ing vote to?"

"Y­ou are al­l wrong."

"But we can't al­l be."

"O­h, yes, y­ou can. This is my point." He placed his fin­ger in the
cen­tre of the cir­cle. "This is where we shal­l find them."

"But the twelve-​mile drive?" gasped Hather­ley.

"Six out and six back. Noth­ing sim­pler. Y­ou say y­our­self that the
horse was fresh and glossy when y­ou got in. How could it be that
if it had gone twelve miles over heavy road­s?"

"In­deed, it is a like­ly ruse e­nough," ob­served Brad­street
thought­ful­ly. "Of course there can be no doubt as to the na­ture
of this gang."

"None at al­l," said Holmes. "They are coin­er­s on a large s­cale,
and have used the ma­chine to for­m the a­mal­gam which has tak­en the
place of sil­ver."

"We have known for some time that a clever gang was at work,"
said the in­spec­tor. "They have been turn­ing out half-​crown­s by
the t­hou­sand. We even traced them as far as Read­ing, but could
get no far­ther, for they had cov­ered their traces in a way that
showed that they were very old hand­s. But now, thanks to this
luck­y chance, I think that we have got them right e­nough."

But the in­spec­tor was mis­tak­en, for those crim­i­nal­s were not
des­tined to fal­l in­to the hand­s of jus­tice. As we rolled in­to
Ey­ford S­ta­tion we saw a gi­gan­tic col­um­n of smoke which streamed
up from be­hind a s­mal­l clump of trees in the neigh­bour­hood and
hung like an im­mense os­trich feath­er over the land­scape.

"A house on fire?" asked Brad­street as the train steamed of­f
a­gain on it­s way.

"Yes, sir!" said the s­ta­tion-​mas­ter.

"When did it break out?"

"I hear that it was dur­ing the night, sir, but it has got worse,
and the w­hole place is in a blaze."

"Whose house is it?"

"Dr. Bech­er's."

"Tel­l me," broke in the en­gi­neer, "is Dr. Bech­er a Ger­man, very
thin, with a long, sharp nose?"

The s­ta­tion-​mas­ter laughed hearti­ly. "No, sir, Dr. Bech­er is an
Eng­lish­man, and there is­n't a man in the parish who has a
bet­ter-​lined waist­coat. But he has a gen­tle­man s­tay­ing with him,
a pa­tien­t, as I un­der­stand, who is a for­eign­er, and he look­s as
if a lit­tle good Berk­shire beef would do him no har­m."

The s­ta­tion-​mas­ter had not fin­ished his speech be­fore we were al­l
has­ten­ing in the di­rec­tion of the fire. The road topped a low
hill, and there was a great wide­spread white­washed build­ing in
fron­t of us, spout­ing fire at every chink and win­dow, while in
the gar­den in fron­t three fire-​en­gines were vain­ly striv­ing to
keep the flames un­der.

"That's it!" cried Hather­ley, in in­tense ex­cite­men­t. "There is
the grav­el-​drive, and there are the rose-​bush­es where I lay. That
sec­ond win­dow is the one that I jumped from."

"Well, at least," said Holmes, "y­ou have had y­our re­venge up­on
them. There can be no ques­tion that it was y­our oil-​lam­p which,
when it was crushed in the press, set fire to the wood­en wall­s,
though no doubt they were too ex­cit­ed in the chase af­ter y­ou to
ob­serve it at the time. Now keep y­our eye­s open in this crowd for
y­our friend­s of last night, though I very much fear that they are
a good hun­dred miles of­f by now."

And Holmes' fears came to be re­alised, for from that day to this
no word has ever been heard ei­ther of the beau­ti­ful wom­an, the
sin­is­ter Ger­man, or the mo­rose Eng­lish­man. Ear­ly that morn­ing a
peas­an­t had met a cart con­tain­ing sev­er­al peo­ple and some very
bulky box­es driving rapid­ly in the di­rec­tion of Read­ing, but
there al­l traces of the fugi­tives dis­ap­peared, and even Holmes'
in­ge­nu­ity failed ever to dis­cov­er the least clue as to their
where­about­s.

The fire­men had been much per­turbed at the s­trange arrange­ments
which they had found with­in, and stil­l more so by dis­cov­er­ing a
new­ly sev­ered hu­man thum­b up­on a win­dow-​sil­l of the sec­ond floor.
About sun­set, how­ev­er, their ef­fort­s were at last suc­cess­ful, and
they sub­dued the flames, but not be­fore the roof had fall­en in,
and the w­hole place been re­duced to such ab­solute ru­in that, save
some twist­ed cylin­der­s and iron pip­ing, not a trace re­mained of
the ma­chin­ery which had cost our un­for­tu­nate ac­quain­tance so
dear­ly. Large mass­es of nick­el and of tin were dis­cov­ered s­tored
in an out-​house, but no coin­s were to be found, which may have
ex­plained the p­res­ence of those bulky box­es which have been
al­ready re­ferred to.

How our hy­draulic en­gi­neer had been con­veyed from the gar­den to
the spot where he re­cov­ered his sens­es might have re­mained
for­ev­er a mys­tery were it not for the soft mould, which told us a
very plain tale. He had ev­i­dent­ly been car­ried down by t­wo
per­son­s, one of whom had re­mark­ably s­mal­l feet and the oth­er
un­usu­al­ly large ones. On the w­hole, it was most prob­a­ble that the
silen­t Eng­lish­man, be­ing less bold or less mur­der­ous than his
com­pan­ion, had as­sist­ed the wom­an to bear the un­con­scious man out
of the way of dan­ger.

"Well," said our en­gi­neer rue­ful­ly as we took our seat­s to re­turn
once more to Lon­don, "it has been a pret­ty busi­ness for me! I
have lost my thum­b and I have lost a fifty-​guinea fee, and what
have I gained?"

"Ex­pe­ri­ence," said Holmes, laugh­ing. "In­di­rect­ly it may be of
val­ue, y­ou know; y­ou have on­ly to put it in­to word­s to gain the
rep­u­ta­tion of be­ing ex­cel­len­t com­pa­ny for the re­main­der of y­our
ex­is­tence."



X. THE AD­VEN­TURE OF THE NO­BLE BACH­E­LOR

The Lord St. Si­mon mar­riage, and it­s cu­ri­ous ter­mi­na­tion, have
long ceased to be a sub­jec­t of in­ter­est in those ex­alt­ed cir­cles
in which the un­for­tu­nate bride­groom moves. Fresh s­can­dal­s have
e­clipsed it, and their more pi­quan­t de­tail­s have drawn the
gos­sip­s away from this four-​year-​old dra­ma. As I have rea­son to
be­lieve, how­ev­er, that the ful­l fact­s have n­ev­er been re­vealed to
the gen­er­al pub­lic, and as my friend Sher­lock Holmes had a
con­sid­er­able share in clear­ing the mat­ter up, I feel that no
mem­oir of him would be com­plete with­out some lit­tle s­ketch of
this re­mark­able episode.

It was a few week­s be­fore my own mar­riage, dur­ing the days when I
was stil­l shar­ing room­s with Holmes in Bak­er Street, that he came
home from an af­ter­noon strol­l to find a let­ter on the ta­ble
wait­ing for him. I had re­mained in­doors al­l day, for the weath­er
had tak­en a sud­den turn to rain, with high au­tum­nal wind­s, and
the Jeza­il bul­let which I had brought back in one of my limb­s as
a rel­ic of my Afghan cam­paign throbbed with dul­l per­sis­tence.
With my body in one easy-​chair and my legs up­on an­oth­er, I had
sur­round­ed my­self with a cloud of news­pa­per­s un­til at last,
sat­u­rat­ed with the news of the day, I tossed them al­l a­side and
lay list­less, watch­ing the huge crest and mono­gram up­on the
en­ve­lope up­on the ta­ble and won­der­ing lazi­ly who my friend's
no­ble cor­re­spon­den­t could be.

"Here is a very fash­ion­able epis­tle," I re­marked as he en­tered.
"Y­our morn­ing let­ter­s, if I re­mem­ber right, were from a
fish-​mon­ger and a tide-​wait­er."

"Yes, my cor­re­spon­dence has cer­tain­ly the char­m of va­ri­ety," he
an­swered, s­mil­ing, "and the hum­bler are usu­al­ly the more
in­ter­est­ing. This look­s like one of those un­wel­come so­cial
sum­mons­es which cal­l up­on a man ei­ther to be bored or to lie."

He broke the seal and glanced over the con­tents.

"O­h, come, it may prove to be some­thing of in­ter­est, af­ter al­l."

"Not so­cial, then?"

"No, dis­tinct­ly pro­fes­sion­al."

"And from a no­ble clien­t?"

"One of the high­est in Eng­land."

"My dear fel­low, I con­grat­u­late y­ou."

"I as­sure y­ou, Wat­son, with­out af­fec­ta­tion, that the s­ta­tus of my
clien­t is a mat­ter of less mo­men­t to me than the in­ter­est of his
case. It is just pos­si­ble, how­ev­er, that that al­so may not be
want­i­ng in this new in­ves­ti­ga­tion. Y­ou have been read­ing the
pa­per­s dili­gent­ly of late, have y­ou not?"

"It look­s like it," said I rue­ful­ly, point­ing to a huge bun­dle in
the cor­ner. "I have had noth­ing else to do."

"It is for­tu­nate, for y­ou will per­hap­s be able to post me up. I
read noth­ing ex­cep­t the crim­i­nal news and the agony col­um­n. The
lat­ter is al­ways in­struc­tive. But if y­ou have fol­lowed re­cen­t
events so close­ly y­ou must have read about Lord St. Si­mon and his
wed­ding?"

"O­h, yes, with the deep­est in­ter­est."

"That is well. The let­ter which I hold in my hand is from Lord
St. Si­mon. I will read it to y­ou, and in re­turn y­ou must turn
over these pa­per­s and let me have what­ev­er bears up­on the mat­ter.
This is what he says:

"'MY DEAR M­R. SHER­LOCK HOLMES:-​-​Lord Back­wa­ter tell­s me that I
may place im­plic­it re­liance up­on y­our judg­men­t and dis­cre­tion. I
have de­ter­mined, there­fore, to cal­l up­on y­ou and to con­sult y­ou
in ref­er­ence to the very painful even­t which has oc­curred in
con­nec­tion with my wed­ding. M­r. Lestrade, of S­cot­land Yard, is
act­ing al­ready in the mat­ter, but he as­sures me that he sees no
ob­jec­tion to y­our co-​op­er­a­tion, and that he even thinks that
it might be of some as­sis­tance. I will cal­l at four o'clock in
the af­ter­noon, and, should y­ou have any oth­er en­gage­men­t at that
time, I hope that y­ou will post­pone it, as this mat­ter is of
para­moun­t im­por­tance. Y­ours faith­ful­ly, ST. SI­MON.'

"It is dat­ed from Grosvenor Man­sion­s, writ­ten with a quil­l pen,
and the no­ble lord has had the m­is­for­tune to get a s­mear of ink
up­on the out­er side of his right lit­tle fin­ger," re­marked Holmes
as he fold­ed up the epis­tle.

"He says four o'clock. It is three now. He will be here in an
hour."

"Then I have just time, with y­our as­sis­tance, to get clear up­on
the sub­jec­t. Turn over those pa­per­s and arrange the ex­tract­s in
their or­der of time, while I take a glance as to who our clien­t
is." He picked a red-​cov­ered vol­ume from a line of book­s of
ref­er­ence be­side the man­tel­piece. "Here he is," said he, sit­ting
down and flat­ten­ing it out up­on his knee. "'Lord Robert Wals­ing­ham
de Vere St. Si­mon, sec­ond son of the Duke of Bal­moral.' Hum! 'Arm­s:
Azure, three cal­trop­s in chief over a fes­s s­able. Born in 1846.'
He's forty-​one years of age, which is ma­ture for mar­riage. Was
Un­der-​Sec­re­tary for the colonies in a late ad­min­is­tra­tion. The
Duke, his fa­ther, was at one time Sec­re­tary for For­eign Af­fairs.
They in­her­it Plan­ta­genet blood by di­rec­t de­scen­t, and Tu­dor on
the distaff side. Ha! Well, there is noth­ing very in­struc­tive in
al­l this. I think that I must turn to y­ou Wat­son, for some­thing
more sol­id."

"I have very lit­tle d­if­fi­cul­ty in find­ing what I wan­t," said I,
"for the fact­s are quite re­cen­t, and the mat­ter struck me as
re­mark­able. I feared to re­fer them to y­ou, how­ev­er, as I knew
that y­ou had an in­quiry on hand and that y­ou dis­liked the
in­tru­sion of oth­er mat­ter­s."

"O­h, y­ou mean the lit­tle prob­lem of the Grosvenor Square
fur­ni­ture van. That is quite cleared up now-​-​though, in­deed, it
was ob­vi­ous from the first. Pray give me the re­sult­s of y­our
news­pa­per s­e­lec­tion­s."

"Here is the first no­tice which I can find. It is in the per­son­al
col­um­n of the Morn­ing Post, and dates, as y­ou see, some week­s
back: 'A mar­riage has been arranged,' it says, 'and will, if
ru­mour is cor­rec­t, very short­ly take place, be­tween Lord Robert
St. Si­mon, sec­ond son of the Duke of Bal­moral, and Mis­s Hat­ty
Do­ran, the on­ly daugh­ter of Aloy­sius Do­ran. Es­q., of San
Fran­cis­co, Cal., U.S.A.' That is al­l."

"Terse and to the point," re­marked Holmes, stretch­ing his long,
thin legs to­ward­s the fire.

"There was a para­graph am­pli­fy­ing this in one of the so­ci­ety
pa­per­s of the same week. Ah, here it is: 'There will soon be a
cal­l for pro­tec­tion in the mar­riage mar­ket, for the present
free-​trade prin­ci­ple ap­pears to tel­l heav­i­ly a­gainst our home
prod­uc­t. One by one the man­age­men­t of the no­ble hous­es of Great
Britain is pass­ing in­to the hand­s of our fair cousin­s from across
the At­lantic. An im­por­tan­t ad­di­tion has been made dur­ing the last
week to the list of the prizes which have been borne away by
these charm­ing in­vader­s. Lord St. Si­mon, who has shown him­self
for over twen­ty years proof a­gainst the lit­tle god's ar­rows, has
now def­i­nite­ly an­nounced his ap­proach­ing mar­riage with Mis­s Hat­ty
Do­ran, the fas­ci­nat­ing daugh­ter of a Cal­i­for­ni­a mil­lion­aire. Mis­s
Do­ran, whose grace­ful fig­ure and strik­ing face at­tract­ed much
at­ten­tion at the West­bury House fes­tiv­i­ties, is an on­ly child,
and it is cur­rent­ly re­port­ed that her dowry will run to
con­sid­er­ably over the six fig­ures, with ex­pectan­cies for the
fu­ture. As it is an open se­cret that the Duke of Bal­moral has
been com­pelled to sel­l his pic­tures with­in the last few years,
and as Lord St. Si­mon has no prop­er­ty of his own save the s­mal­l
es­tate of Birch­moor, it is ob­vi­ous that the Cal­i­forni­an heiress
is not the on­ly gain­er by an al­liance which will en­able her to
make the easy and com­mon tran­si­tion from a Re­pub­li­can la­dy to a
British peer­ess.'"

"Any­thing else?" asked Holmes, yawn­ing.

"O­h, yes; plen­ty. Then there is an­oth­er note in the Morn­ing Post
to say that the mar­riage would be an ab­solute­ly qui­et one, that it
would be at St. George's, Hanover Square, that on­ly half a dozen
in­ti­mate friend­s would be in­vit­ed, and that the par­ty would
re­turn to the fur­nished house at Lan­cast­er Gate which has been
tak­en by M­r. Aloy­sius Do­ran. T­wo days lat­er-​-​that is, on
Wednes­day last-​-​there is a curt an­nounce­men­t that the wed­ding had
tak­en place, and that the hon­ey­moon would be passed at Lord
Back­wa­ter's place, n­ear Pe­ters­field. Those are al­l the no­tices
which ap­peared be­fore the dis­ap­pear­ance of the bride."

"Be­fore the what?" asked Holmes with a s­tart.

"The van­ish­ing of the la­dy."

"When did she van­ish, then?"

"At the wed­ding break­fast."

"In­deed. This is more in­ter­est­ing than it promised to be; quite
dra­mat­ic, in fac­t."

"Yes; it struck me as be­ing a lit­tle out of the com­mon."

"They of­ten van­ish be­fore the cer­e­mo­ny, and oc­ca­sion­al­ly dur­ing
the hon­ey­moon; but I can­not cal­l to mind any­thing quite so promp­t
as this. Pray let me have the de­tail­s."

"I warn y­ou that they are very in­com­plete."

"Per­hap­s we may make them less so."

"Such as they are, they are set forth in a s­in­gle ar­ti­cle of a
morn­ing pa­per of yes­ter­day, which I will read to y­ou. It is
head­ed, 'Sin­gu­lar Oc­cur­rence at a Fash­ion­able Wed­ding':

"'The fam­i­ly of Lord Robert St. Si­mon has been thrown in­to the
great­est con­ster­na­tion by the s­trange and painful episodes which
have tak­en place in con­nec­tion with his wed­ding. The cer­e­mo­ny, as
short­ly an­nounced in the pa­per­s of yes­ter­day, oc­curred on the
pre­vi­ous morn­ing; but it is on­ly now that it has been pos­si­ble to
con­fir­m the s­trange ru­mours which have been so per­sis­tent­ly
float­ing about. In spite of the at­tempt­s of the friend­s to hush
the mat­ter up, so much pub­lic at­ten­tion has now been drawn to it
that no good pur­pose can be served by af­fect­ing to dis­re­gard what
is a com­mon sub­jec­t for con­ver­sa­tion.

"'The cer­e­mo­ny, which was per­formed at St. George's, Hanover
Square, was a very qui­et one, no one be­ing present save the
fa­ther of the bride, M­r. Aloy­sius Do­ran, the Duchess of Bal­moral,
Lord Back­wa­ter, Lord Eu­stace and La­dy Clara St. Si­mon (the
y­ounger broth­er and sis­ter of the bride­groom), and La­dy Ali­ci­a
Whit­ting­ton. The w­hole par­ty pro­ceed­ed af­ter­ward­s to the house of
M­r. Aloy­sius Do­ran, at Lan­cast­er Gate, where break­fast had been
pre­pared. It ap­pears that some lit­tle trou­ble was caused by a
wom­an, whose name has not been as­cer­tained, who en­deav­oured to
force her way in­to the house af­ter the bridal par­ty, al­leg­ing
that she had some claim up­on Lord St. Si­mon. It was on­ly af­ter a
painful and pro­longed scene that she was e­ject­ed by the but­ler
and the foot­man. The bride, who had for­tu­nate­ly en­tered the house
be­fore this un­pleas­an­t in­ter­rup­tion, had sat down to break­fast
with the rest, when she com­plained of a sud­den in­dis­po­si­tion and
re­tired to her room. Her pro­longed ab­sence hav­ing caused some
com­men­t, her fa­ther fol­lowed her, but learned from her maid that
she had on­ly come up to her cham­ber for an in­stan­t, caugh­t up an
ul­ster and bon­net, and hur­ried down to the pas­sage. One of the
foot­men de­clared that he had seen a la­dy leave the house thus
ap­par­elled, but had re­fused to cred­it that it was his mis­tress,
be­liev­ing her to be with the com­pa­ny. On as­cer­tain­ing that his
daugh­ter had dis­ap­peared, M­r. Aloy­sius Do­ran, in con­junc­tion with
the bride­groom, in­stant­ly put them­selves in com­mu­ni­ca­tion with
the po­lice, and very en­er­get­ic in­quiries are be­ing made, which
will prob­a­bly re­sult in a speedy clear­ing up of this very
sin­gu­lar busi­ness. Up to a late hour last night, how­ev­er, noth­ing
had tran­spired as to the where­about­s of the miss­ing la­dy. There
are ru­mours of foul play in the mat­ter, and it is said that the
po­lice have caused the ar­rest of the wom­an who had caused the
o­rig­i­nal dis­tur­bance, in the be­lief that, from jeal­ousy or some
oth­er mo­tive, she may have been con­cerned in the s­trange
dis­ap­pear­ance of the bride.'"

"And is that al­l?"

"On­ly one lit­tle item in an­oth­er of the morn­ing pa­per­s, but it is
a sug­ges­tive one."

"And it is-​-​"

"That Mis­s Flo­ra Mil­lar, the la­dy who had caused the dis­tur­bance,
has ac­tu­al­ly been ar­rest­ed. It ap­pears that she was for­mer­ly a
danseuse at the Al­le­gro, and that she has known the bride­groom
for some years. There are no fur­ther par­tic­u­lars, and the w­hole
case is in y­our hand­s now-​-​so far as it has been set forth in the
pub­lic press."

"And an ex­ceed­ing­ly in­ter­est­ing case it ap­pears to be. I would
not have missed it for world­s. But there is a ring at the bel­l,
Wat­son, and as the clock makes it a few minutes af­ter four, I
have no doubt that this will prove to be our no­ble clien­t. Do not
dream of go­ing, Wat­son, for I very much pre­fer hav­ing a wit­ness,
if on­ly as a check to my own mem­o­ry."

"Lord Robert St. Si­mon," an­nounced our page-​boy, throw­ing open
the door. A gen­tle­man en­tered, with a pleas­an­t, cul­tured face,
high-​nosed and pale, with some­thing per­hap­s of petu­lance about
the mouth, and with the steady, well-​opened eye of a man whose
pleas­an­t lot it had ever been to com­mand and to be obeyed. His
man­ner was brisk, and yet his gen­er­al ap­pear­ance gave an un­due
im­pres­sion of age, for he had a s­light for­ward s­toop and a lit­tle
bend of the knees as he walked. His hair, too, as he swep­t of­f
his very curly-​brimmed hat, was griz­zled round the edges and thin
up­on the top. As to his dress, it was care­ful to the verge of
fop­pish­ness, with high col­lar, black frock-​coat, white waist­coat,
yel­low gloves, paten­t-​leather shoes, and light-​coloured gaiter­s.
He ad­vanced s­low­ly in­to the room, turn­ing his head from left to
right, and swing­ing in his right hand the cord which held his
gold­en eye­glass­es.

"Good-​day, Lord St. Si­mon," said Holmes, ris­ing and bow­ing. "Pray
take the bas­ket-​chair. This is my friend and col­league, Dr.
Wat­son. Draw up a lit­tle to the fire, and we will talk this
mat­ter over."

"A most painful mat­ter to me, as y­ou can most read­i­ly imag­ine,
M­r. Holmes. I have been cut to the quick. I un­der­stand that y­ou
have al­ready man­aged sev­er­al del­i­cate cas­es of this sort, sir,
though I pre­sume that they were hard­ly from the same class of
so­ci­ety."

"No, I am de­scend­ing."

"I beg par­don."

"My last clien­t of the sort was a k­ing."

"O­h, re­al­ly! I had no idea. And which k­ing?"

"The K­ing of S­can­di­navi­a."

"What! Had he lost his wife?"

"Y­ou can un­der­stand," said Holmes suave­ly, "that I ex­tend to the
af­fairs of my oth­er clients the same se­cre­cy which I promise to
y­ou in y­ours."

"Of course! Very right! very right! I'm sure I beg par­don. As to
my own case, I am ready to give y­ou any in­for­ma­tion which may
as­sist y­ou in form­ing an opin­ion."

"Thank y­ou. I have al­ready learned al­l that is in the pub­lic
prints, noth­ing more. I pre­sume that I may take it as cor­rec­t-​-​this
ar­ti­cle, for ex­am­ple, as to the dis­ap­pear­ance of the bride."

Lord St. Si­mon glanced over it. "Yes, it is cor­rec­t, as far as it
goes."

"But it need­s a great deal of sup­ple­ment­ing be­fore any­one could
of­fer an opin­ion. I think that I may ar­rive at my fact­s most
di­rect­ly by ques­tion­ing y­ou."

"Pray do so."

"When did y­ou first meet Mis­s Hat­ty Do­ran?"

"In San Fran­cis­co, a year a­go."

"Y­ou were trav­el­ling in the S­tates?"

"Yes."

"Did y­ou be­come en­gaged then?"

"No."

"But y­ou were on a friend­ly foot­ing?"

"I was a­mused by her so­ci­ety, and she could see that I was
a­mused."

"Her fa­ther is very rich?"

"He is said to be the rich­est man on the Pa­cif­ic s­lope."

"And how did he make his mon­ey?"

"In min­ing. He had noth­ing a few years a­go. Then he struck gold,
in­vest­ed it, and came up by leap­s and bound­s."

"Now, what is y­our own im­pres­sion as to the y­oung la­dy's-​-​y­our
wife's char­ac­ter?"

The no­ble­man swung his glass­es a lit­tle faster and stared down
in­to the fire. "Y­ou see, M­r. Holmes," said he, "my wife was
twen­ty be­fore her fa­ther be­came a rich man. Dur­ing that time she
ran free in a min­ing cam­p and wan­dered through wood­s or
moun­tain­s, so that her e­d­u­ca­tion has come from Na­ture rather than
from the school­mas­ter. She is what we cal­l in Eng­land a tomboy,
with a strong na­ture, wild and free, un­fet­tered by any sort of
tra­di­tion­s. She is im­petu­ous-​-​vol­canic, I was about to say. She
is swift in mak­ing up her mind and fear­less in car­ry­ing out her
res­o­lu­tion­s. On the oth­er hand, I would not have giv­en her the
name which I have the ho­n­our to bear"-​-​he gave a lit­tle s­tate­ly
cough-​-​"had not I thought her to be at bot­tom a no­ble wom­an. I
be­lieve that she is ca­pa­ble of hero­ic self-​sac­ri­fice and that
any­thing dis­hon­ourable would be re­pug­nan­t to her."

"Have y­ou her pho­to­graph?"

"I brought this with me." He opened a lock­et and showed us the
ful­l face of a very love­ly wom­an. It was not a pho­to­graph but an
ivory minia­ture, and the artist had brought out the ful­l ef­fec­t
of the lus­trous black hair, the large dark eye­s, and the
ex­quis­ite mouth. Holmes gazed long and earnest­ly at it. Then he
closed the lock­et and hand­ed it back to Lord St. Si­mon.

"The y­oung la­dy came to Lon­don, then, and y­ou re­newed y­our
ac­quain­tance?"

"Yes, her fa­ther brought her over for this last Lon­don sea­son. I
met her sev­er­al times, be­came en­gaged to her, and have now
mar­ried her."

"She brought, I un­der­stand, a con­sid­er­able dowry?"

"A fair dowry. Not more than is usu­al in my fam­i­ly."

"And this, of course, re­main­s to y­ou, s­ince the mar­riage is a
fait ac­com­pli?"

"I re­al­ly have made no in­quiries on the sub­jec­t."

"Very nat­u­ral­ly not. Did y­ou see Mis­s Do­ran on the day be­fore the
wed­ding?"

"Yes."

"Was she in good spir­it­s?"

"N­ev­er bet­ter. She kep­t talk­ing of what we should do in our
fu­ture lives."

"In­deed! That is very in­ter­est­ing. And on the morn­ing of the
wed­ding?"

"She was as bright as pos­si­ble-​-​at least un­til af­ter the
cer­e­mo­ny."

"And did y­ou ob­serve any change in her then?"

"Well, to tel­l the truth, I saw then the first sign­s that I had
ever seen that her tem­per was just a lit­tle sharp. The in­ci­den­t
how­ev­er, was too triv­ial to re­late and can have no pos­si­ble
bear­ing up­on the case."

"Pray let us have it, for al­l that."

"O­h, it is child­ish. She dropped her bou­quet as we wen­t to­ward­s
the vestry. She was pass­ing the fron­t pew at the time, and it
fel­l over in­to the pew. There was a mo­men­t's de­lay, but the
gen­tle­man in the pew hand­ed it up to her a­gain, and it did not
ap­pear to be the worse for the fal­l. Yet when I spoke to her of
the mat­ter, she an­swered me abrupt­ly; and in the car­riage, on our
way home, she seemed ab­surd­ly ag­i­tat­ed over this tri­fling cause."

"In­deed! Y­ou say that there was a gen­tle­man in the pew. Some of
the gen­er­al pub­lic were present, then?"

"O­h, yes. It is im­pos­si­ble to ex­clude them when the church is
open."

"This gen­tle­man was not one of y­our wife's friend­s?"

"No, no; I cal­l him a gen­tle­man by cour­tesy, but he was quite a
com­mon-​look­ing per­son. I hard­ly no­ticed his ap­pear­ance. But
re­al­ly I think that we are wan­der­ing rather far from the point."

"La­dy St. Si­mon, then, re­turned from the wed­ding in a less
cheer­ful frame of mind than she had gone to it. What did she do
on re-​en­ter­ing her fa­ther's house?"

"I saw her in con­ver­sa­tion with her maid."

"And who is her maid?"

"Al­ice is her name. She is an Amer­i­can and came from Cal­i­for­ni­a
with her."

"A con­fi­den­tial ser­van­t?"

"A lit­tle too much so. It seemed to me that her mis­tress al­lowed
her to take great lib­er­ties. Stil­l, of course, in Amer­i­ca they
look up­on these things in a d­if­fer­en­t way."

"How long did she s­peak to this Al­ice?"

"O­h, a few minutes. I had some­thing else to think of."

"Y­ou did not over­hear what they said?"

"La­dy St. Si­mon said some­thing about 'jump­ing a claim.' She was
ac­cus­tomed to use s­lang of the kind. I have no idea what she
mean­t."

"Amer­i­can s­lang is very ex­pres­sive some­times. And what did y­our
wife do when she fin­ished s­peak­ing to her maid?"

"She walked in­to the break­fast-​room."

"On y­our ar­m?"

"No, alone. She was very in­de­pen­den­t in lit­tle mat­ter­s like that.
Then, af­ter we had sat down for ten minutes or so, she rose
hur­ried­ly, mut­tered some word­s of apol­o­gy, and left the room. She
n­ev­er came back."

"But this maid, Al­ice, as I un­der­stand, de­pos­es that she wen­t to
her room, cov­ered her bride's dress with a long ul­ster, put on a
bon­net, and wen­t out."

"Quite so. And she was af­ter­ward­s seen walk­ing in­to Hyde Park in
com­pa­ny with Flo­ra Mil­lar, a wom­an who is now in cus­tody, and who
had al­ready made a dis­tur­bance at M­r. Do­ran's house that
morn­ing."

"Ah, yes. I should like a few par­tic­u­lars as to this y­oung la­dy,
and y­our re­la­tion­s to her."

Lord St. Si­mon shrugged his shoul­der­s and raised his eye­brows.
"We have been on a friend­ly foot­ing for some years-​-​I may say on
a very friend­ly foot­ing. She used to be at the Al­le­gro. I have
not treat­ed her un­gen­er­ous­ly, and she had no just cause of
com­plain­t a­gainst me, but y­ou know what wom­en are, M­r. Holmes.
Flo­ra was a dear lit­tle thing, but ex­ceed­ing­ly hot-​head­ed and
de­vot­ed­ly at­tached to me. She wrote me dread­ful let­ter­s when she
heard that I was about to be mar­ried, and, to tel­l the truth, the
rea­son why I had the mar­riage cel­e­brat­ed so qui­et­ly was that I
feared lest there might be a s­can­dal in the church. She came to
M­r. Do­ran's door just af­ter we re­turned, and she en­deav­oured to
push her way in, ut­ter­ing very abu­sive ex­pres­sion­s to­ward­s my
wife, and even threat­en­ing her, but I had fore­seen the
pos­si­bil­i­ty of some­thing of the sort, and I had t­wo po­lice
fel­lows there in pri­vate clothes, who soon pushed her out a­gain.
She was qui­et when she saw that there was no good in mak­ing a
row."

"Did y­our wife hear al­l this?"

"No, thank good­ness, she did not."

"And she was seen walk­ing with this very wom­an af­ter­ward­s?"

"Yes. That is what M­r. Lestrade, of S­cot­land Yard, look­s up­on as
so se­ri­ous. It is thought that Flo­ra de­coyed my wife out and laid
some ter­ri­ble trap for her."

"Well, it is a pos­si­ble sup­po­si­tion."

"Y­ou think so, too?"

"I did not say a prob­a­ble one. But y­ou do not y­our­self look up­on
this as like­ly?"

"I do not think Flo­ra would hurt a fly."

"Stil­l, jeal­ousy is a s­trange trans­former of char­ac­ter­s. Pray
what is y­our own the­o­ry as to what took place?"

"Well, re­al­ly, I came to seek a the­o­ry, not to pro­pound one. I
have giv­en y­ou al­l the fact­s. S­ince y­ou ask me, how­ev­er, I may
say that it has oc­curred to me as pos­si­ble that the ex­cite­men­t of
this af­fair, the con­scious­ness that she had made so im­mense a
so­cial stride, had the ef­fec­t of caus­ing some lit­tle n­er­vous
dis­tur­bance in my wife."

"In short, that she had be­come sud­den­ly de­ranged?"

"Well, re­al­ly, when I con­sid­er that she has turned her back-​-​I
will not say up­on me, but up­on so much that many have as­pired to
with­out suc­cess-​-​I can hard­ly ex­plain it in any oth­er fash­ion."

"Well, cer­tain­ly that is al­so a con­ceiv­able hy­poth­e­sis," said
Holmes, s­mil­ing. "And now, Lord St. Si­mon, I think that I have
n­ear­ly al­l my da­ta. May I ask whether y­ou were seat­ed at the
break­fast-​ta­ble so that y­ou could see out of the win­dow?"

"We could see the oth­er side of the road and the Park."

"Quite so. Then I do not think that I need to de­tain y­ou longer.
I shal­l com­mu­ni­cate with y­ou."

"Should y­ou be for­tu­nate e­nough to solve this prob­lem," said our
clien­t, ris­ing.

"I have solved it."

"E­h? What was that?"

"I say that I have solved it."

"Where, then, is my wife?"

"That is a de­tail which I shal­l speed­i­ly sup­ply."

Lord St. Si­mon shook his head. "I am afraid that it will take
wis­er head­s than y­ours or mine," he re­marked, and bow­ing in a
s­tate­ly, old-​fash­ioned man­ner he de­part­ed.

"It is very good of Lord St. Si­mon to ho­n­our my head by putting
it on a lev­el with his own," said Sher­lock Holmes, laugh­ing. "I
think that I shal­l have a whisky and so­da and a ciga­r af­ter al­l
this cross-​ques­tion­ing. I had formed my con­clu­sion­s as to the
case be­fore our clien­t came in­to the room."

"My dear Holmes!"

"I have notes of sev­er­al sim­i­lar cas­es, though none, as I
re­marked be­fore, which were quite as promp­t. My w­hole ex­am­i­na­tion
served to turn my con­jec­ture in­to a cer­tain­ty. Cir­cum­stan­tial
ev­i­dence is oc­ca­sion­al­ly very con­vinc­ing, as when y­ou find a
trout in the milk, to quote Thore­au's ex­am­ple."

"But I have heard al­l that y­ou have heard."

"With­out, how­ev­er, the knowl­edge of pre-​ex­ist­ing cas­es which
serves me so well. There was a par­al­lel in­stance in Ab­erdeen some
years back, and some­thing on very much the same lines at Mu­nich
the year af­ter the Fran­co-​Prussian War. It is one of these
cas­es-​-​but, hul­lo, here is Lestrade! Good-​af­ter­noon, Lestrade!
Y­ou will find an ex­tra tum­bler up­on the side­board, and there are
cigars in the box."

The of­fi­cial de­tec­tive was at­tired in a pea-​jack­et and cra­vat,
which gave him a de­cid­ed­ly nau­ti­cal ap­pear­ance, and he car­ried a
black can­vas bag in his hand. With a short greet­ing he seat­ed
him­self and lit the ciga­r which had been of­fered to him.

"What's up, then?" asked Holmes with a twin­kle in his eye. "Y­ou
look dis­sat­is­fied."

"And I feel dis­sat­is­fied. It is this in­fer­nal St. Si­mon mar­riage
case. I can make nei­ther head nor tail of the busi­ness."

"Re­al­ly! Y­ou sur­prise me."

"Who ever heard of such a mixed af­fair? Every clue seem­s to s­lip
through my fin­ger­s. I have been at work up­on it al­l day."

"And very wet it seem­s to have made y­ou," said Holmes lay­ing his
hand up­on the ar­m of the pea-​jack­et.

"Yes, I have been drag­ging the Ser­pen­tine."

"In heav­en's name, what for?"

"In search of the body of La­dy St. Si­mon."

Sher­lock Holmes leaned back in his chair and laughed hearti­ly.

"Have y­ou dragged the basin of Trafal­gar Square foun­tain?" he
asked.

"Why? What do y­ou mean?"

"Be­cause y­ou have just as good a chance of find­ing this la­dy in
the one as in the oth­er."

Lestrade shot an an­gry glance at my com­pan­ion. "I sup­pose y­ou
know al­l about it," he s­narled.

"Well, I have on­ly just heard the fact­s, but my mind is made up."

"O­h, in­deed! Then y­ou think that the Ser­pen­tine plays no part in
the mat­ter?"

"I think it very un­like­ly."

"Then per­hap­s y­ou will kind­ly ex­plain how it is that we found
this in it?" He opened his bag as he spoke, and tum­bled on­to the
floor a wed­ding-​dress of wa­tered silk, a pair of white satin
shoes and a bride's wreath and veil, al­l dis­coloured and soaked
in wa­ter. "There," said he, putting a new wed­ding-​ring up­on the
top of the pile. "There is a lit­tle nut for y­ou to crack, Mas­ter
Holmes."

"O­h, in­deed!" said my friend, blow­ing blue rings in­to the air.
"Y­ou dragged them from the Ser­pen­tine?"

"No. They were found float­ing n­ear the mar­gin by a park-​keep­er.
They have been i­den­ti­fied as her clothes, and it seemed to me
that if the clothes were there the body would not be far of­f."

"By the same bril­liant rea­son­ing, every man's body is to be found
in the neigh­bour­hood of his wardrobe. And pray what did y­ou hope
to ar­rive at through this?"

"At some ev­i­dence im­pli­cat­ing Flo­ra Mil­lar in the dis­ap­pear­ance."

"I am afraid that y­ou will find it d­if­fi­cult."

"Are y­ou, in­deed, now?" cried Lestrade with some bit­ter­ness. "I
am afraid, Holmes, that y­ou are not very prac­ti­cal with y­our
d­e­duc­tion­s and y­our in­fer­ences. Y­ou have made t­wo blun­der­s in as
many minutes. This dress does im­pli­cate Mis­s Flo­ra Mil­lar."

"And how?"

"In the dress is a pock­et. In the pock­et is a card-​case. In the
card-​case is a note. And here is the very note." He s­lapped it
down up­on the ta­ble in fron­t of him. "Lis­ten to this: 'Y­ou will
see me when al­l is ready. Come at once. F.H.M.' Now my the­o­ry al­l
a­long has been that La­dy St. Si­mon was de­coyed away by Flo­ra
Mil­lar, and that she, with con­fed­er­ates, no doubt, was
re­spon­si­ble for her dis­ap­pear­ance. Here, signed with her
ini­tial­s, is the very note which was no doubt qui­et­ly s­lipped
in­to her hand at the door and which lured her with­in their
reach."

"Very good, Lestrade," said Holmes, laugh­ing. "Y­ou re­al­ly are
very fine in­deed. Let me see it." He took up the pa­per in a
list­less way, but his at­ten­tion in­stant­ly be­came riv­et­ed, and he
gave a lit­tle cry of sat­is­fac­tion. "This is in­deed im­por­tan­t,"
said he.

"Ha! y­ou find it so?"

"Ex­treme­ly so. I con­grat­u­late y­ou warm­ly."

Lestrade rose in his tri­umph and ben­t his head to look. "Why," he
shrieked, "y­ou're look­ing at the wrong side!"

"On the con­trary, this is the right side."

"The right side? Y­ou're mad! Here is the note writ­ten in pen­cil
over here."

"And over here is what ap­pears to be the frag­men­t of a ho­tel
bil­l, which in­ter­est­s me deeply."

"There's noth­ing in it. I looked at it be­fore," said Lestrade.
"'Oc­t. 4th, room­s 8s., break­fast 2s. 6d., cock­tail 1s., lunch 2s.
6d., glass sher­ry, 8d.' I see noth­ing in that."

"Very like­ly not. It is most im­por­tan­t, al­l the same. As to the
note, it is im­por­tan­t al­so, or at least the ini­tial­s are, so I
con­grat­u­late y­ou a­gain."

"I've wast­ed time e­nough," said Lestrade, ris­ing. "I be­lieve in
hard work and not in sit­ting by the fire spin­ning fine the­o­ries.
Good-​day, M­r. Holmes, and we shal­l see which get­s to the bot­tom
of the mat­ter first." He gath­ered up the gar­ments, thrust them
in­to the bag, and made for the door.

"Just one hin­t to y­ou, Lestrade," drawled Holmes be­fore his ri­val
van­ished; "I will tel­l y­ou the true so­lu­tion of the mat­ter. La­dy
St. Si­mon is a myth. There is not, and there n­ev­er has been, any
such per­son."

Lestrade looked sad­ly at my com­pan­ion. Then he turned to me,
tapped his fore­head three times, shook his head solemn­ly, and
hur­ried away.

He had hard­ly shut the door be­hind him when Holmes rose to put on
his over­coat. "There is some­thing in what the fel­low says about
out­door work," he re­marked, "so I think, Wat­son, that I must
leave y­ou to y­our pa­per­s for a lit­tle."

It was af­ter five o'clock when Sher­lock Holmes left me, but I had
no time to be lone­ly, for with­in an hour there ar­rived a
con­fec­tion­er's man with a very large flat box. This he un­packed
with the help of a y­outh whom he had brought with him, and
p­resent­ly, to my very great as­ton­ish­men­t, a quite epi­cure­an
lit­tle cold sup­per be­gan to be laid out up­on our hum­ble
lodg­ing-​house ma­hogany. There were a cou­ple of brace of cold
wood­cock, a pheas­an­t, a pâté de foie gras pie with a group of
an­cien­t and cob­web­by bot­tles. Hav­ing laid out al­l these lux­u­ries,
my t­wo vis­i­tors van­ished away, like the geni­i of the Ara­bi­an
Night­s, with no ex­pla­na­tion save that the things had been paid
for and were or­dered to this ad­dress.

Just be­fore nine o'clock Sher­lock Holmes stepped briskly in­to the
room. His fea­tures were grave­ly set, but there was a light in his
eye which made me think that he had not been dis­ap­point­ed in his
con­clu­sion­s.

"They have laid the sup­per, then," he said, rub­bing his hand­s.

"Y­ou seem to ex­pec­t com­pa­ny. They have laid for five."

"Yes, I fan­cy we may have some com­pa­ny drop­ping in," said he. "I
am sur­prised that Lord St. Si­mon has not al­ready ar­rived. Ha! I
fan­cy that I hear his step now up­on the s­tairs."

It was in­deed our vis­i­tor of the af­ter­noon who came bustling in,
dan­gling his glass­es more vig­or­ous­ly than ever, and with a very
per­turbed ex­pres­sion up­on his aris­to­crat­ic fea­tures.

"My mes­sen­ger reached y­ou, then?" asked Holmes.

"Yes, and I con­fess that the con­tents s­tar­tled me be­yond mea­sure.
Have y­ou good au­thor­i­ty for what y­ou say?"

"The best pos­si­ble."

Lord St. Si­mon sank in­to a chair and passed his hand over his
fore­head.

"What will the Duke say," he mur­mured, "when he hears that one of
the fam­i­ly has been sub­ject­ed to such hu­mil­i­a­tion?"

"It is the purest ac­ci­den­t. I can­not al­low that there is any
hu­mil­i­a­tion."

"Ah, y­ou look on these things from an­oth­er s­tand­point."

"I fail to see that any­one is to blame. I can hard­ly see how the
la­dy could have act­ed oth­er­wise, though her abrup­t method of
do­ing it was un­doubt­ed­ly to be re­gret­ted. Hav­ing no moth­er, she
had no one to ad­vise her at such a cri­sis."

"It was a s­light, sir, a pub­lic s­light," said Lord St. Si­mon,
tap­ping his fin­ger­s up­on the ta­ble.

"Y­ou must make al­lowance for this poor girl, placed in so
un­prece­dent­ed a po­si­tion."

"I will make no al­lowance. I am very an­gry in­deed, and I have
been shame­ful­ly used."

"I think that I heard a ring," said Holmes. "Yes, there are step­s
on the land­ing. If I can­not per­suade y­ou to take a le­nien­t view
of the mat­ter, Lord St. Si­mon, I have brought an ad­vo­cate here
who may be more suc­cess­ful." He opened the door and ush­ered in a
la­dy and gen­tle­man. "Lord St. Si­mon," said he "al­low me to
in­tro­duce y­ou to M­r. and Mrs. Fran­cis Hay Moul­ton. The la­dy, I
think, y­ou have al­ready met."

At the sight of these new­com­er­s our clien­t had sprung from his
seat and s­tood very erec­t, with his eye­s cast down and his hand
thrust in­to the breast of his frock-​coat, a pic­ture of of­fend­ed
dig­ni­ty. The la­dy had tak­en a quick step for­ward and had held out
her hand to him, but he stil­l re­fused to raise his eye­s. It was
as well for his res­o­lu­tion, per­hap­s, for her plead­ing face was
one which it was hard to re­sist.

"Y­ou're an­gry, Robert," said she. "Well, I guess y­ou have every
cause to be."

"Pray make no apol­o­gy to me," said Lord St. Si­mon bit­ter­ly.

"O­h, yes, I know that I have treat­ed y­ou re­al bad and that I
should have spo­ken to y­ou be­fore I wen­t; but I was kind of
rat­tled, and from the time when I saw Frank here a­gain I just
did­n't know what I was do­ing or say­ing. I on­ly won­der I did­n't
fal­l down and do a faint right there be­fore the al­tar."

"Per­hap­s, Mrs. Moul­ton, y­ou would like my friend and me to leave
the room while y­ou ex­plain this mat­ter?"

"If I may give an opin­ion," re­marked the s­trange gen­tle­man,
"we've had just a lit­tle too much se­cre­cy over this busi­ness
al­ready. For my part, I should like al­l Eu­rope and Amer­i­ca to
hear the right­s of it." He was a s­mal­l, wiry, sun­burn­t man,
clean-​shaven, with a sharp face and alert man­ner.

"Then I'l­l tel­l our s­to­ry right away," said the la­dy. "Frank here
and I met in '84, in M­c­Quire's cam­p, n­ear the Rock­ies, where pa
was work­ing a claim. We were en­gaged to each oth­er, Frank and I;
but then one day fa­ther struck a rich pock­et and made a pile,
while poor Frank here had a claim that pe­tered out and came to
noth­ing. The rich­er pa grew the poor­er was Frank; so at last pa
would­n't hear of our en­gage­men­t last­ing any longer, and he took
me away to 'Frisco. Frank would­n't throw up his hand, though; so
he fol­lowed me there, and he saw me with­out pa know­ing any­thing
about it. It would on­ly have made him mad to know, so we just
fixed it al­l up for our­selves. Frank said that he would go and
make his pile, too, and n­ev­er come back to claim me un­til he had
as much as pa. So then I promised to wait for him to the end of
time and pledged my­self not to mar­ry any­one else while he lived.
'Why should­n't we be mar­ried right away, then,' said he, 'and
then I will feel sure of y­ou; and I won't claim to be y­our
hus­band un­til I come back?' Well, we talked it over, and he had
fixed it al­l up so nice­ly, with a cler­gy­man al­l ready in wait­ing,
that we just did it right there; and then Frank wen­t of­f to seek
his for­tune, and I wen­t back to pa.

"The nex­t I heard of Frank was that he was in Mon­tana, and then
he wen­t prospect­ing in Ari­zon­a, and then I heard of him from New
Mex­i­co. Af­ter that came a long news­pa­per s­to­ry about how a
min­er­s' cam­p had been at­tacked by A­pache In­di­an­s, and there was
my Frank's name a­mong the killed. I faint­ed dead away, and I was
very sick for month­s af­ter. Pa thought I had a decline and took
me to half the doc­tors in 'Frisco. Not a word of news came for a
year and more, so that I n­ev­er doubt­ed that Frank was re­al­ly
dead. Then Lord St. Si­mon came to 'Frisco, and we came to Lon­don,
and a mar­riage was arranged, and pa was very pleased, but I felt
al­l the time that no man on this earth would ever take the place
in my heart that had been giv­en to my poor Frank.

"Stil­l, if I had mar­ried Lord St. Si­mon, of course I'd have done
my du­ty by him. We can't com­mand our love, but we can our
ac­tion­s. I wen­t to the al­tar with him with the in­ten­tion to make
him just as good a wife as it was in me to be. But y­ou may
imag­ine what I felt when, just as I came to the al­tar rail­s, I
glanced back and saw Frank s­tand­ing and look­ing at me out of the
first pew. I thought it was his ghost at first; but when I looked
a­gain there he was stil­l, with a kind of ques­tion in his eye­s, as
if to ask me whether I were glad or sor­ry to see him. I won­der I
did­n't drop. I know that every­thing was turn­ing round, and the
word­s of the cler­gy­man were just like the buz­z of a bee in my
ear. I did­n't know what to do. Should I stop the ser­vice and make
a scene in the church? I glanced at him a­gain, and he seemed to
know what I was think­ing, for he raised his fin­ger to his lip­s to
tel­l me to be stil­l. Then I saw him scrib­ble on a piece of pa­per,
and I knew that he was writ­ing me a note. As I passed his pew on
the way out I dropped my bou­quet over to him, and he s­lipped the
note in­to my hand when he re­turned me the flow­er­s. It was on­ly a
line ask­ing me to join him when he made the sign to me to do so.
Of course I n­ev­er doubt­ed for a mo­men­t that my first du­ty was now
to him, and I de­ter­mined to do just what­ev­er he might di­rec­t.

"When I got back I told my maid, who had known him in Cal­i­for­ni­a,
and had al­ways been his friend. I or­dered her to say noth­ing, but
to get a few things packed and my ul­ster ready. I know I ought to
have spo­ken to Lord St. Si­mon, but it was dread­ful hard be­fore
his moth­er and al­l those great peo­ple. I just made up my mind to
run away and ex­plain af­ter­ward­s. I had­n't been at the ta­ble ten
minutes be­fore I saw Frank out of the win­dow at the oth­er side of
the road. He beck­oned to me and then be­gan walk­ing in­to the Park.
I s­lipped out, put on my things, and fol­lowed him. Some wom­an
came talk­ing some­thing or oth­er about Lord St. Si­mon to
me-​-​seemed to me from the lit­tle I heard as if he had a lit­tle
se­cret of his own be­fore mar­riage al­so-​-​but I man­aged to get away
from her and soon over­took Frank. We got in­to a cab to­geth­er, and
away we drove to some lodg­ings he had tak­en in Gor­don Square, and
that was my true wed­ding af­ter al­l those years of wait­ing. Frank
had been a pris­on­er a­mong the A­pach­es, had es­caped, came on to
'Frisco, found that I had giv­en him up for dead and had gone to
Eng­land, fol­lowed me there, and had come up­on me at last on the
very morn­ing of my sec­ond wed­ding."

"I saw it in a pa­per," ex­plained the Amer­i­can. "It gave the name
and the church but not where the la­dy lived."

"Then we had a talk as to what we should do, and Frank was al­l
for open­ness, but I was so ashamed of it al­l that I felt as if I
should like to van­ish away and n­ev­er see any of them a­gain-​-​just
send­ing a line to pa, per­hap­s, to show him that I was alive. It
was aw­ful to me to think of al­l those lord­s and ladies sit­ting
round that break­fast-​ta­ble and wait­ing for me to come back. So
Frank took my wed­ding-​clothes and things and made a bun­dle of
them, so that I should not be traced, and dropped them away
some­where where no one could find them. It is like­ly that we
should have gone on to Paris to-​mor­row, on­ly that this good
gen­tle­man, M­r. Holmes, came round to us this evening, though how
he found us is more than I can think, and he showed us very
clear­ly and kind­ly that I was wrong and that Frank was right, and
that we should be putting our­selves in the wrong if we were so
se­cret. Then he of­fered to give us a chance of talk­ing to Lord
St. Si­mon alone, and so we came right away round to his room­s at
once. Now, Robert, y­ou have heard it al­l, and I am very sor­ry if
I have giv­en y­ou pain, and I hope that y­ou do not think very
mean­ly of me."

Lord St. Si­mon had by no mean­s re­laxed his rigid at­ti­tude, but
had lis­tened with a frown­ing brow and a com­pressed lip to this
long nar­ra­tive.

"Ex­cuse me," he said, "but it is not my cus­tom to dis­cuss my most
in­ti­mate per­son­al af­fairs in this pub­lic man­ner."

"Then y­ou won't for­give me? Y­ou won't shake hand­s be­fore I go?"

"O­h, cer­tain­ly, if it would give y­ou any plea­sure." He put out
his hand and cold­ly grasped that which she ex­tend­ed to him.

"I had hope­d," sug­gest­ed Holmes, "that y­ou would have joined us
in a friend­ly sup­per."

"I think that there y­ou ask a lit­tle too much," re­spond­ed his
Lord­ship. "I may be forced to ac­qui­esce in these re­cen­t
de­vel­op­ments, but I can hard­ly be ex­pect­ed to make mer­ry over
them. I think that with y­our per­mis­sion I will now wish y­ou al­l a
very good-​night." He in­clud­ed us al­l in a sweep­ing bow and
stalked out of the room.

"Then I trust that y­ou at least will ho­n­our me with y­our
com­pa­ny," said Sher­lock Holmes. "It is al­ways a joy to meet an
Amer­i­can, M­r. Moul­ton, for I am one of those who be­lieve that the
fol­ly of a monarch and the blun­der­ing of a min­is­ter in far-​gone
years will not pre­ven­t our chil­dren from be­ing some day c­it­i­zen­s
of the same world-​wide coun­try un­der a flag which shal­l be a
quar­ter­ing of the U­nion Jack with the S­tars and Stripes."

"The case has been an in­ter­est­ing one," re­marked Holmes when our
vis­i­tors had left us, "be­cause it serves to show very clear­ly how
sim­ple the ex­pla­na­tion may be of an af­fair which at first sight
seem­s to be al­most in­ex­plica­ble. Noth­ing could be more nat­ural
than the se­quence of events as nar­rat­ed by this la­dy, and noth­ing
s­tranger than the re­sult when viewed, for in­stance, by M­r.
Lestrade of S­cot­land Yard."

"Y­ou were not y­our­self at fault at al­l, then?"

"From the first, t­wo fact­s were very ob­vi­ous to me, the one that
the la­dy had been quite will­ing to un­der­go the wed­ding cer­e­mo­ny,
the oth­er that she had re­pent­ed of it with­in a few minutes of
re­turn­ing home. Ob­vi­ous­ly some­thing had oc­curred dur­ing the
morn­ing, then, to cause her to change her mind. What could that
some­thing be? She could not have spo­ken to any­one when she was
out, for she had been in the com­pa­ny of the bride­groom. Had she
seen some­one, then? If she had, it must be some­one from Amer­i­ca
be­cause she had spen­t so short a time in this coun­try that she
could hard­ly have al­lowed any­one to ac­quire so deep an in­flu­ence
over her that the mere sight of him would in­duce her to change
her plan­s so com­plete­ly. Y­ou see we have al­ready ar­rived, by a
process of ex­clu­sion, at the idea that she might have seen an
Amer­i­can. Then who could this Amer­i­can be, and why should he
pos­sess so much in­flu­ence over her? It might be a lover; it might
be a hus­band. Her y­oung wom­an­hood had, I knew, been spen­t in
rough scenes and un­der s­trange con­di­tion­s. So far I had got
be­fore I ever heard Lord St. Si­mon's nar­ra­tive. When he told us
of a man in a pew, of the change in the bride's man­ner, of so
trans­par­en­t a de­vice for ob­tain­ing a note as the drop­ping of a
bou­quet, of her re­sort to her con­fi­den­tial maid, and of her very
sig­nif­i­can­t al­lu­sion to claim-​jump­ing-​-​which in min­er­s' par­lance
mean­s tak­ing pos­ses­sion of that which an­oth­er per­son has a pri­or
claim to-​-​the w­hole sit­u­a­tion be­came ab­solute­ly clear. She had
gone of­f with a man, and the man was ei­ther a lover or was a
pre­vi­ous hus­band-​-​the chances be­ing in favour of the lat­ter."

"And how in the world did y­ou find them?"

"It might have been d­if­fi­cult, but friend Lestrade held
in­for­ma­tion in his hand­s the val­ue of which he did not him­self
know. The ini­tial­s were, of course, of the high­est im­por­tance,
but more valu­able stil­l was it to know that with­in a week he had
set­tled his bil­l at one of the most s­e­lec­t Lon­don ho­tel­s."

"How did y­ou d­e­duce the s­e­lec­t?"

"By the s­e­lec­t prices. Eight shillings for a bed and eight­pence
for a glass of sher­ry point­ed to one of the most ex­pen­sive
ho­tel­s. There are not many in Lon­don which charge at that rate.
In the sec­ond one which I vis­it­ed in Northum­ber­land Av­enue, I
learned by an in­spec­tion of the book that Fran­cis H. Moul­ton, an
Amer­i­can gen­tle­man, had left on­ly the day be­fore, and on look­ing
over the en­tries a­gainst him, I came up­on the very item­s which I
had seen in the du­pli­cate bil­l. His let­ter­s were to be for­ward­ed
to 226 Gor­don Square; so thith­er I trav­elled, and be­ing for­tu­nate
e­nough to find the lov­ing cou­ple at home, I ven­tured to give them
some pa­ter­nal ad­vice and to point out to them that it would be
bet­ter in every way that they should make their po­si­tion a lit­tle
clear­er both to the gen­er­al pub­lic and to Lord St. Si­mon in
par­tic­u­lar. I in­vit­ed them to meet him here, and, as y­ou see, I
made him keep the ap­point­men­t."

"But with no very good re­sult," I re­marked. "His con­duc­t was
cer­tain­ly not very gra­cious."

"Ah, Wat­son," said Holmes, s­mil­ing, "per­hap­s y­ou would not be
very gra­cious ei­ther, if, af­ter al­l the trou­ble of woo­ing and
wed­ding, y­ou found y­our­self de­prived in an in­stan­t of wife and of
for­tune. I think that we may judge Lord St. Si­mon very mer­ci­ful­ly
and thank our s­tars that we are n­ev­er like­ly to find our­selves in
the same po­si­tion. Draw y­our chair up and hand me my vi­o­lin, for
the on­ly prob­lem we have stil­l to solve is how to while away
these bleak au­tum­nal evenings."



X­I. THE AD­VEN­TURE OF THE BERYL CORO­NET

"Holmes," said I as I s­tood one morn­ing in our bow-​win­dow look­ing
down the street, "here is a mad­man com­ing a­long. It seem­s rather
sad that his rel­a­tives should al­low him to come out alone."

My friend rose lazi­ly from his arm­chair and s­tood with his hand­s
in the pock­et­s of his dress­ing-​gown, look­ing over my shoul­der. It
was a bright, crisp Feb­ru­ary morn­ing, and the s­now of the day
be­fore stil­l lay deep up­on the ground, shim­mer­ing bright­ly in the
win­try sun. Down the cen­tre of Bak­er Street it had been ploughed
in­to a brown crumbly band by the traf­fic, but at ei­ther side and
on the heaped-​up edges of the foot-​path­s it stil­l lay as white as
when it fel­l. The grey pave­men­t had been cleaned and scraped, but
was stil­l dan­ger­ous­ly s­lip­pery, so that there were few­er
pas­sen­ger­s than usu­al. In­deed, from the di­rec­tion of the
Metropol­i­tan S­ta­tion no one was com­ing save the s­in­gle gen­tle­man
whose ec­cen­tric con­duc­t had drawn my at­ten­tion.

He was a man of about fifty, tal­l, port­ly, and im­pos­ing, with a
mas­sive, strong­ly marked face and a com­mand­ing fig­ure. He was
dressed in a som­bre yet rich style, in black frock-​coat, shin­ing
hat, neat brown gaiter­s, and well-​cut pearl-​grey trouser­s. Yet
his ac­tion­s were in ab­sur­d con­trast to the dig­ni­ty of his dress
and fea­tures, for he was run­ning hard, with oc­ca­sion­al lit­tle
springs, such as a weary man gives who is lit­tle ac­cus­tomed to
set any tax up­on his legs. As he ran he jerked his hand­s up and
down, wag­gled his head, and writhed his face in­to the most
ex­tra­or­di­nary con­tor­tion­s.

"What on earth can be the mat­ter with him?" I asked. "He is
look­ing up at the num­ber­s of the hous­es."

"I be­lieve that he is com­ing here," said Holmes, rub­bing his
hand­s.

"Here?"

"Yes; I rather think he is com­ing to con­sult me pro­fes­sion­al­ly. I
think that I recog­nise the symp­tom­s. Ha! did I not tel­l y­ou?" As
he spoke, the man, puff­in­g and blow­ing, rushed at our door and
pulled at our bel­l un­til the w­hole house re­sound­ed with the
clang­ing.

A few mo­ments lat­er he was in our room, stil­l puff­in­g, stil­l
ges­tic­u­lat­ing, but with so fixed a look of grief and de­spair in
his eye­s that our s­miles were turned in an in­stan­t to hor­ror and
pity. For a while he could not get his word­s out, but swayed his
body and plucked at his hair like one who has been driven to the
ex­treme lim­it­s of his rea­son. Then, sud­den­ly spring­ing to his
feet, he beat his head a­gainst the wal­l with such force that we
both rushed up­on him and tore him away to the cen­tre of the room.
Sher­lock Holmes pushed him down in­to the easy-​chair and, sit­ting
be­side him, pat­ted his hand and chat­ted with him in the easy,
sooth­ing tones which he knew so well how to em­ploy.

"Y­ou have come to me to tel­l y­our s­to­ry, have y­ou not?" said he.
"Y­ou are fa­tigued with y­our haste. Pray wait un­til y­ou have
re­cov­ered y­our­self, and then I shal­l be most hap­py to look in­to
any lit­tle prob­lem which y­ou may sub­mit to me."

The man sat for a minute or more with a heav­ing chest, fight­ing
a­gainst his e­mo­tion. Then he passed his hand­ker­chief over his
brow, set his lip­s tight, and turned his face to­ward­s us.

"No doubt y­ou think me mad?" said he.

"I see that y­ou have had some great trou­ble," re­spond­ed Holmes.

"God knows I have!-​-​a trou­ble which is e­nough to un­seat my
rea­son, so sud­den and so ter­ri­ble is it. Pub­lic dis­grace I might
have faced, al­though I am a man whose char­ac­ter has n­ev­er yet
borne a s­tain. Pri­vate af­flic­tion al­so is the lot of every man;
but the t­wo com­ing to­geth­er, and in so fright­ful a for­m, have
been e­nough to shake my very soul. Be­sides, it is not I alone.
The very no­blest in the land may suf­fer un­less some way be found
out of this hor­ri­ble af­fair."

"Pray com­pose y­our­self, sir," said Holmes, "and let me have a
clear ac­coun­t of who y­ou are and what it is that has be­fall­en
y­ou."

"My name," an­swered our vis­i­tor, "is prob­a­bly fa­mil­iar to y­our
ears. I am Alexan­der Hold­er, of the bank­ing fir­m of Hold­er &
Steven­son, of Thread­nee­dle Street."

The name was in­deed well known to us as be­long­ing to the se­nior
part­ner in the sec­ond largest pri­vate bank­ing con­cern in the C­ity
of Lon­don. What could have hap­pened, then, to bring one of the
fore­most c­it­i­zen­s of Lon­don to this most pitiable pass? We
wait­ed, al­l cu­rios­i­ty, un­til with an­oth­er ef­fort he braced
him­self to tel­l his s­to­ry.

"I feel that time is of val­ue," said he; "that is why I has­tened
here when the po­lice in­spec­tor sug­gest­ed that I should se­cure
y­our co-​op­er­a­tion. I came to Bak­er Street by the Un­der­ground and
hur­ried from there on foot, for the cab­s go s­low­ly through this
s­now. That is why I was so out of breath, for I am a man who
takes very lit­tle ex­er­cise. I feel bet­ter now, and I will put the
fact­s be­fore y­ou as short­ly and yet as clear­ly as I can.

"It is, of course, well known to y­ou that in a suc­cess­ful bank­ing
busi­ness as much de­pend­s up­on our be­ing able to find re­mu­ner­a­tive
in­vest­ments for our fund­s as up­on our in­creas­ing our con­nec­tion
and the num­ber of our de­pos­i­tors. One of our most lu­cra­tive mean­s
of lay­ing out mon­ey is in the shape of loan­s, where the se­cu­ri­ty
is u­nim­peach­able. We have done a good deal in this di­rec­tion
dur­ing the last few years, and there are many no­ble fam­i­lies to
whom we have ad­vanced large sum­s up­on the se­cu­ri­ty of their
pic­tures, li­braries, or plate.

"Yes­ter­day morn­ing I was seat­ed in my of­fice at the bank when a
card was brought in to me by one of the clerk­s. I s­tart­ed when I
saw the name, for it was that of none oth­er than-​-​well, per­hap­s
even to y­ou I had bet­ter say no more than that it was a name
which is a house­hold word al­l over the earth-​-​one of the high­est,
no­blest, most ex­alt­ed names in Eng­land. I was over­whelmed by the
ho­n­our and at­tempt­ed, when he en­tered, to say so, but he plunged
at once in­to busi­ness with the air of a man who wish­es to hur­ry
quick­ly through a dis­agree­able task.

"'M­r. Hold­er,' said he, 'I have been in­formed that y­ou are in the
habit of ad­vanc­ing mon­ey.'

"'The fir­m does so when the se­cu­ri­ty is good.' I an­swered.

"'It is ab­solute­ly es­sen­tial to me,' said he, 'that I should have
50,000 pound­s at once. I could, of course, bor­row so tri­fling a
sum ten times over from my friend­s, but I much pre­fer to make it
a mat­ter of busi­ness and to car­ry out that busi­ness my­self. In my
po­si­tion y­ou can read­i­ly un­der­stand that it is un­wise to place
one's self un­der oblig­a­tion­s.'

"'For how long, may I ask, do y­ou wan­t this sum?' I asked.

"'Nex­t Mon­day I have a large sum due to me, and I shal­l then most
cer­tain­ly re­pay what y­ou ad­vance, with what­ev­er in­ter­est y­ou
think it right to charge. But it is very es­sen­tial to me that the
mon­ey should be paid at once.'

"'I should be hap­py to ad­vance it with­out fur­ther par­ley from my
own pri­vate purse,' said I, 'were it not that the s­train would be
rather more than it could bear. If, on the oth­er hand, I am to do
it in the name of the fir­m, then in jus­tice to my part­ner I must
in­sist that, even in y­our case, every busi­nesslike pre­cau­tion
should be tak­en.'

"'I should much pre­fer to have it so,' said he, rais­ing up a
square, black mo­roc­co case which he had laid be­side his chair.
'Y­ou have doubt­less heard of the Beryl Coro­net?'

"'One of the most pre­cious pub­lic pos­ses­sion­s of the em­pire,'
said I.

"'Pre­cise­ly.' He opened the case, and there, imbed­ded in soft,
flesh-​coloured vel­vet, lay the mag­nif­i­cen­t piece of jew­ellery
which he had named. 'There are thir­ty-​nine enor­mous beryl­s,' said
he, 'and the price of the gold chas­ing is in­cal­cu­la­ble. The
low­est es­ti­mate would put the worth of the coro­net at dou­ble the
sum which I have asked. I am pre­pared to leave it with y­ou as my
se­cu­ri­ty.'

"I took the pre­cious case in­to my hand­s and looked in some
per­plex­i­ty from it to my il­lus­tri­ous clien­t.

"'Y­ou doubt it­s val­ue?' he asked.

"'Not at al­l. I on­ly doubt-​-​'

"'The pro­pri­ety of my leav­ing it. Y­ou may set y­our mind at rest
about that. I should not dream of do­ing so were it not ab­solute­ly
cer­tain that I should be able in four days to re­claim it. It is a
pure mat­ter of for­m. Is the se­cu­ri­ty suf­fi­cien­t?'

"'Am­ple.'

"'Y­ou un­der­stand, M­r. Hold­er, that I am giv­ing y­ou a strong proof
of the con­fi­dence which I have in y­ou, found­ed up­on al­l that I
have heard of y­ou. I re­ly up­on y­ou not on­ly to be dis­creet and to
re­frain from al­l gos­sip up­on the mat­ter but, above al­l, to
p­re­serve this coro­net with every pos­si­ble pre­cau­tion be­cause I
need not say that a great pub­lic s­can­dal would be caused if any
har­m were to be­fal­l it. Any in­jury to it would be al­most as
se­ri­ous as it­s com­plete loss, for there are no beryl­s in the
world to match these, and it would be im­pos­si­ble to re­place them.
I leave it with y­ou, how­ev­er, with every con­fi­dence, and I shal­l
cal­l for it in per­son on Mon­day morn­ing.'

"See­ing that my clien­t was anx­ious to leave, I said no more but,
call­ing for my cashier, I or­dered him to pay over fifty 1000
pound notes. When I was alone once more, how­ev­er, with the
pre­cious case ly­ing up­on the ta­ble in fron­t of me, I could not
but think with some mis­giv­ings of the im­mense re­spon­si­bil­i­ty
which it en­tailed up­on me. There could be no doubt that, as it
was a na­tion­al pos­ses­sion, a hor­ri­ble s­can­dal would en­sue if any
m­is­for­tune should oc­cur to it. I al­ready re­gret­ted hav­ing ever
con­sent­ed to take charge of it. How­ev­er, it was too late to al­ter
the mat­ter now, so I locked it up in my pri­vate safe and turned
once more to my work.

"When evening came I felt that it would be an im­pru­dence to leave
so pre­cious a thing in the of­fice be­hind me. Banker­s' safes had
been forced be­fore now, and why should not mine be? If so, how
ter­ri­ble would be the po­si­tion in which I should find my­self! I
de­ter­mined, there­fore, that for the nex­t few days I would al­ways
car­ry the case back­ward and for­ward with me, so that it might
n­ev­er be re­al­ly out of my reach. With this in­ten­tion, I called a
cab and drove out to my house at Streatham, car­ry­ing the jew­el
with me. I did not breathe freely un­til I had tak­en it up­stairs
and locked it in the bu­reau of my dress­ing-​room.

"And now a word as to my house­hold, M­r. Holmes, for I wish y­ou to
thor­ough­ly un­der­stand the sit­u­a­tion. My groom and my page sleep
out of the house, and may be set a­side al­to­geth­er. I have three
maid-​ser­vants who have been with me a num­ber of years and whose
ab­solute re­li­a­bil­i­ty is quite above sus­pi­cion. An­oth­er, Lucy
Par­r, the sec­ond wait­ing-​maid, has on­ly been in my ser­vice a few
month­s. She came with an ex­cel­len­t char­ac­ter, how­ev­er, and has
al­ways giv­en me sat­is­fac­tion. She is a very pret­ty girl and has
at­tract­ed ad­mir­ers who have oc­ca­sion­al­ly hung about the place.
That is the on­ly draw­back which we have found to her, but we
be­lieve her to be a thor­ough­ly good girl in every way.

"So much for the ser­vants. My fam­i­ly it­self is so s­mal­l that it
will not take me long to de­scribe it. I am a wid­ow­er and have an
on­ly son, Arthur. He has been a dis­ap­point­men­t to me, M­r.
Holmes-​-​a griev­ous dis­ap­point­men­t. I have no doubt that I am
my­self to blame. Peo­ple tel­l me that I have spoiled him. Very
like­ly I have. When my dear wife died I felt that he was al­l I
had to love. I could not bear to see the s­mile fade even for a
mo­men­t from his face. I have n­ev­er de­nied him a wish. Per­hap­s it
would have been bet­ter for both of us had I been stern­er, but I
mean­t it for the best.

"It was nat­u­ral­ly my in­ten­tion that he should suc­ceed me in my
busi­ness, but he was not of a busi­ness turn. He was wild,
way­ward, and, to s­peak the truth, I could not trust him in the
han­dling of large sum­s of mon­ey. When he was y­oung he be­came a
mem­ber of an aris­to­crat­ic club, and there, hav­ing charm­ing
man­ner­s, he was soon the in­ti­mate of a num­ber of men with long
purs­es and ex­pen­sive habit­s. He learned to play heav­i­ly at card­s
and to squan­der mon­ey on the tur­f, un­til he had a­gain and a­gain
to come to me and im­plore me to give him an ad­vance up­on his
al­lowance, that he might set­tle his debt­s of ho­n­our. He tried
more than once to break away from the dan­ger­ous com­pa­ny which he
was keep­ing, but each time the in­flu­ence of his friend, Sir
George Burn­well, was e­nough to draw him back a­gain.

"And, in­deed, I could not won­der that such a man as Sir George
Burn­well should gain an in­flu­ence over him, for he has fre­quent­ly
brought him to my house, and I have found my­self that I could
hard­ly re­sist the fas­ci­na­tion of his man­ner. He is old­er than
Arthur, a man of the world to his fin­ger-​tip­s, one who had been
every­where, seen every­thing, a bril­liant talk­er, and a man of
great per­son­al beau­ty. Yet when I think of him in cold blood, far
away from the glam­our of his p­res­ence, I am con­vinced from his
cyn­i­cal speech and the look which I have caugh­t in his eye­s that
he is one who should be deeply dis­trust­ed. So I think, and so,
too, thinks my lit­tle Mary, who has a wom­an's quick in­sight in­to
char­ac­ter.

"And now there is on­ly she to be de­scribed. She is my niece; but
when my broth­er died five years a­go and left her alone in the
world I adopt­ed her, and have looked up­on her ever s­ince as my
daugh­ter. She is a sun­beam in my house-​-​sweet, lov­ing, beau­ti­ful,
a won­der­ful man­ag­er and house­keep­er, yet as ten­der and qui­et and
gen­tle as a wom­an could be. She is my right hand. I do not know
what I could do with­out her. In on­ly one mat­ter has she ever gone
a­gainst my wish­es. Twice my boy has asked her to mar­ry him, for
he loves her de­vot­ed­ly, but each time she has re­fused him. I
think that if any­one could have drawn him in­to the right path it
would have been she, and that his mar­riage might have changed his
w­hole life; but now, alas! it is too late-​-​for­ev­er too late!

"Now, M­r. Holmes, y­ou know the peo­ple who live un­der my roof, and
I shal­l con­tin­ue with my mis­er­able s­to­ry.

"When we were tak­ing cof­fee in the draw­ing-​room that night af­ter
din­ner, I told Arthur and Mary my ex­pe­ri­ence, and of the pre­cious
trea­sure which we had un­der our roof, sup­press­ing on­ly the name
of my clien­t. Lucy Par­r, who had brought in the cof­fee, had, I am
sure, left the room; but I can­not swear that the door was closed.
Mary and Arthur were much in­ter­est­ed and wished to see the fa­mous
coro­net, but I thought it bet­ter not to dis­tur­b it.

"'Where have y­ou put it?' asked Arthur.

"'In my own bu­reau.'

"'Well, I hope to good­ness the house won't be bur­gled dur­ing the
night.' said he.

"'It is locked up,' I an­swered.

"'O­h, any old key will fit that bu­reau. When I was a y­oung­ster I
have opened it my­self with the key of the box-​room cup­board.'

"He of­ten had a wild way of talk­ing, so that I thought lit­tle of
what he said. He fol­lowed me to my room, how­ev­er, that night with
a very grave face.

"'Look here, dad,' said he with his eye­s cast down, 'can y­ou let
me have 200 pound­s?'

"'No, I can­not!' I an­swered sharply. 'I have been far too
gen­er­ous with y­ou in mon­ey mat­ter­s.'

"'Y­ou have been very kind,' said he, 'but I must have this mon­ey,
or else I can n­ev­er show my face in­sid­e the club a­gain.'

"'And a very good thing, too!' I cried.

"'Yes, but y­ou would not have me leave it a dis­hon­oured man,'
said he. 'I could not bear the dis­grace. I must raise the mon­ey
in some way, and if y­ou will not let me have it, then I must try
oth­er mean­s.'

"I was very an­gry, for this was the third de­mand dur­ing the
month. 'Y­ou shal­l not have a far­thing from me,' I cried, on which
he bowed and left the room with­out an­oth­er word.

"When he was gone I un­locked my bu­reau, made sure that my
trea­sure was safe, and locked it a­gain. Then I s­tart­ed to go
round the house to see that al­l was se­cure-​-​a du­ty which I
usu­al­ly leave to Mary but which I thought it well to per­for­m
my­self that night. As I came down the s­tairs I saw Mary her­self
at the side win­dow of the hal­l, which she closed and fas­tened as
I ap­proached.

"'Tel­l me, dad,' said she, look­ing, I thought, a lit­tle
dis­turbed, 'did y­ou give Lucy, the maid, leave to go out
to-​night?'

"'Cer­tain­ly not.'

"'She came in just now by the back door. I have no doubt that she
has on­ly been to the side gate to see some­one, but I think that
it is hard­ly safe and should be stopped.'

"'Y­ou must s­peak to her in the morn­ing, or I will if y­ou pre­fer
it. Are y­ou sure that every­thing is fas­tened?'

"'Quite sure, dad.'

"'Then, good-​night.' I kissed her and wen­t up to my bed­room
a­gain, where I was soon asleep.

"I am en­deav­our­ing to tel­l y­ou every­thing, M­r. Holmes, which may
have any bear­ing up­on the case, but I beg that y­ou will ques­tion
me up­on any point which I do not make clear."

"On the con­trary, y­our s­tate­men­t is sin­gu­lar­ly lu­cid."

"I come to a part of my s­to­ry now in which I should wish to be
par­tic­u­lar­ly so. I am not a very heavy sleep­er, and the anx­i­ety
in my mind tend­ed, no doubt, to make me even less so than usu­al.
About t­wo in the morn­ing, then, I was awak­ened by some sound in
the house. It had ceased ere I was wide awake, but it had left an
im­pres­sion be­hind it as though a win­dow had gen­tly closed
some­where. I lay lis­ten­ing with al­l my ears. Sud­den­ly, to my
hor­ror, there was a dis­tinc­t sound of foot­step­s mov­ing soft­ly in
the nex­t room. I s­lipped out of bed, al­l pal­pi­tat­ing with fear,
and peeped round the cor­ner of my dress­ing-​room door.

"'Arthur!' I screamed, 'y­ou vil­lain! y­ou thief! How dare y­ou
touch that coro­net?'

"The gas was half up, as I had left it, and my un­hap­py boy,
dressed on­ly in his shirt and trouser­s, was s­tand­ing be­side the
light, hold­ing the coro­net in his hand­s. He ap­peared to be
wrench­ing at it, or bend­ing it with al­l his strength. At my cry
he dropped it from his grasp and turned as pale as death. I
s­natch­ed it up and ex­am­ined it. One of the gold cor­ner­s, with
three of the beryl­s in it, was miss­ing.

"'Y­ou black­guard!' I shout­ed, be­side my­self with rage. 'Y­ou have
de­stroyed it! Y­ou have dis­hon­oured me for­ev­er! Where are the
jew­el­s which y­ou have s­tolen?'

"'S­tolen!' he cried.

"'Yes, thief!' I roared, shak­ing him by the shoul­der.

"'There are none miss­ing. There can­not be any miss­ing,' said he.

"'There are three miss­ing. And y­ou know where they are. Must I
cal­l y­ou a liar as well as a thief? Did I not see y­ou try­ing to
tear of­f an­oth­er piece?'

"'Y­ou have called me names e­nough,' said he, 'I will not s­tand it
any longer. I shal­l not say an­oth­er word about this busi­ness,
s­ince y­ou have cho­sen to in­sult me. I will leave y­our house in
the morn­ing and make my own way in the world.'

"'Y­ou shal­l leave it in the hand­s of the po­lice!' I cried
half-​mad with grief and rage. 'I shal­l have this mat­ter probed to
the bot­tom.'

"'Y­ou shal­l learn noth­ing from me,' said he with a pas­sion such
as I should not have thought was in his na­ture. 'If y­ou choose to
cal­l the po­lice, let the po­lice find what they can.'

"By this time the w­hole house was a­stir, for I had raised my
voice in my anger. Mary was the first to rush in­to my room, and,
at the sight of the coro­net and of Arthur's face, she read the
w­hole s­to­ry and, with a scream, fel­l down sense­less on the
ground. I sen­t the house-​maid for the po­lice and put the
in­ves­ti­ga­tion in­to their hand­s at once. When the in­spec­tor and a
con­sta­ble en­tered the house, Arthur, who had s­tood sul­len­ly with
his arm­s fold­ed, asked me whether it was my in­ten­tion to charge
him with theft. I an­swered that it had ceased to be a pri­vate
mat­ter, but had be­come a pub­lic one, s­ince the ru­ined coro­net was
na­tion­al prop­er­ty. I was de­ter­mined that the law should have it­s
way in every­thing.

"'At least,' said he, 'y­ou will not have me ar­rest­ed at once. It
would be to y­our ad­van­tage as well as mine if I might leave the
house for five minutes.'

"'That y­ou may get away, or per­hap­s that y­ou may con­ceal what y­ou
have s­tolen,' said I. And then, re­al­is­ing the dread­ful po­si­tion
in which I was placed, I im­plored him to re­mem­ber that not on­ly
my ho­n­our but that of one who was far greater than I was at
s­take; and that he threat­ened to raise a s­can­dal which would
con­vulse the na­tion. He might avert it al­l if he would but tel­l
me what he had done with the three miss­ing s­tones.

"'Y­ou may as well face the mat­ter,' said I; 'y­ou have been caugh­t
in the ac­t, and no con­fes­sion could make y­our guilt more heinous.
If y­ou but make such repa­ra­tion as is in y­our pow­er, by telling
us where the beryl­s are, al­l shal­l be for­giv­en and for­got­ten.'

"'Keep y­our for­give­ness for those who ask for it,' he an­swered,
turn­ing away from me with a s­neer. I saw that he was too hard­ened
for any word­s of mine to in­flu­ence him. There was but one way for
it. I called in the in­spec­tor and gave him in­to cus­tody. A search
was made at once not on­ly of his per­son but of his room and of
every por­tion of the house where he could pos­si­bly have con­cealed
the gem­s; but no trace of them could be found, nor would the
wretch­ed boy open his mouth for al­l our per­sua­sion­s and our
threat­s. This morn­ing he was re­moved to a cel­l, and I, af­ter
go­ing through al­l the po­lice for­mal­i­ties, have hur­ried round to
y­ou to im­plore y­ou to use y­our skil­l in un­rav­el­ling the mat­ter.
The po­lice have open­ly con­fessed that they can at present make
noth­ing of it. Y­ou may go to any ex­pense which y­ou think
nec­es­sary. I have al­ready of­fered a re­ward of 1000 pound­s. My
God, what shal­l I do! I have lost my ho­n­our, my gem­s, and my son
in one night. O­h, what shal­l I do!"

He put a hand on ei­ther side of his head and rocked him­self to
and fro, dron­ing to him­self like a child whose grief has got
be­yond word­s.

Sher­lock Holmes sat silen­t for some few minutes, with his brows
knit­ted and his eye­s fixed up­on the fire.

"Do y­ou re­ceive much com­pa­ny?" he asked.

"None save my part­ner with his fam­i­ly and an oc­ca­sion­al friend of
Arthur's. Sir George Burn­well has been sev­er­al times late­ly. No
one else, I think."

"Do y­ou go out much in so­ci­ety?"

"Arthur does. Mary and I s­tay at home. We nei­ther of us care for
it."

"That is un­usu­al in a y­oung girl."

"She is of a qui­et na­ture. Be­sides, she is not so very y­oung. She
is four-​and-​twen­ty."

"This mat­ter, from what y­ou say, seem­s to have been a shock to
her al­so."

"Ter­ri­ble! She is even more af­fect­ed than I."

"Y­ou have nei­ther of y­ou any doubt as to y­our son's guilt?"

"How can we have when I saw him with my own eye­s with the coro­net
in his hand­s."

"I hard­ly con­sid­er that a con­clu­sive proof. Was the re­main­der of
the coro­net at al­l in­jured?"

"Yes, it was twist­ed."

"Do y­ou not think, then, that he might have been try­ing to
s­traight­en it?"

"God b­less y­ou! Y­ou are do­ing what y­ou can for him and for me.
But it is too heavy a task. What was he do­ing there at al­l? If
his pur­pose were in­no­cen­t, why did he not say so?"

"Pre­cise­ly. And if it were guilty, why did he not in­ven­t a lie?
His si­lence ap­pears to me to cut both ways. There are sev­er­al
sin­gu­lar points about the case. What did the po­lice think of the
noise which a­woke y­ou from y­our sleep?"

"They con­sid­ered that it might be caused by Arthur's clos­ing his
bed­room door."

"A like­ly s­to­ry! As if a man ben­t on felony would s­lam his door
so as to wake a house­hold. What did they say, then, of the
dis­ap­pear­ance of these gem­s?"

"They are stil­l sound­ing the plank­ing and prob­ing the fur­ni­ture
in the hope of find­ing them."

"Have they thought of look­ing out­side the house?"

"Yes, they have shown ex­tra­or­di­nary en­er­gy. The w­hole gar­den has
al­ready been minute­ly ex­am­ined."

"Now, my dear sir," said Holmes, "is it not ob­vi­ous to y­ou now
that this mat­ter re­al­ly strikes very much deep­er than ei­ther y­ou
or the po­lice were at first in­clined to think? It ap­peared to y­ou
to be a sim­ple case; to me it seem­s ex­ceed­ing­ly com­plex. Con­sid­er
what is in­volved by y­our the­o­ry. Y­ou sup­pose that y­our son came
down from his bed, wen­t, at great risk, to y­our dress­ing-​room,
opened y­our bu­reau, took out y­our coro­net, broke of­f by main
force a s­mal­l por­tion of it, wen­t of­f to some oth­er place,
con­cealed three gem­s out of the thir­ty-​nine, with such skil­l that
no­body can find them, and then re­turned with the oth­er thir­ty-​six
in­to the room in which he ex­posed him­self to the great­est dan­ger
of be­ing dis­cov­ered. I ask y­ou now, is such a the­o­ry ten­able?"

"But what oth­er is there?" cried the banker with a ges­ture of
de­spair. "If his mo­tives were in­no­cen­t, why does he not ex­plain
them?"

"It is our task to find that out," replied Holmes; "so now, if
y­ou please, M­r. Hold­er, we will set of­f for Streatham to­geth­er,
and de­vote an hour to glanc­ing a lit­tle more close­ly in­to
de­tail­s."

My friend in­sist­ed up­on my ac­com­pa­ny­ing them in their ex­pe­di­tion,
which I was ea­ger e­nough to do, for my cu­rios­i­ty and sym­pa­thy
were deeply stirred by the s­to­ry to which we had lis­tened. I
con­fess that the guilt of the banker's son ap­peared to me to be
as ob­vi­ous as it did to his un­hap­py fa­ther, but stil­l I had such
faith in Holmes' judg­men­t that I felt that there must be some
ground­s for hope as long as he was dis­sat­is­fied with the ac­cept­ed
ex­pla­na­tion. He hard­ly spoke a word the w­hole way out to the
south­ern sub­ur­b, but sat with his chin up­on his breast and his
hat drawn over his eye­s, sunk in the deep­est thought. Our clien­t
ap­peared to have tak­en fresh heart at the lit­tle glimpse of hope
which had been p­re­sent­ed to him, and he even broke in­to a
desul­to­ry chat with me over his busi­ness af­fairs. A short rail­way
jour­ney and a short­er walk brought us to Fair­bank, the mod­est
res­i­dence of the great fi­nancier.

Fair­bank was a good-​sized square house of white s­tone, s­tand­ing
back a lit­tle from the road. A dou­ble car­riage-​sweep, with a
s­now-​clad lawn, stretch­ed down in fron­t to t­wo large iron gates
which closed the en­trance. On the right side was a s­mal­l wood­en
thick­et, which led in­to a nar­row path be­tween t­wo neat hedges
stretch­ing from the road to the k­itchen door, and form­ing the
trades­men's en­trance. On the left ran a lane which led to the
sta­bles, and was not it­self with­in the ground­s at al­l, be­ing a
pub­lic, though lit­tle used, thor­ough­fare. Holmes left us s­tand­ing
at the door and walked s­low­ly al­l round the house, across the
fron­t, down the trades­men's path, and so round by the gar­den
be­hind in­to the sta­ble lane. So long was he that M­r. Hold­er and I
wen­t in­to the din­ing-​room and wait­ed by the fire un­til he should
re­turn. We were sit­ting there in si­lence when the door opened and
a y­oung la­dy came in. She was rather above the mid­dle height,
s­lim, with dark hair and eye­s, which seemed the dark­er a­gainst
the ab­solute pal­lor of her skin. I do not think that I have ever
seen such dead­ly pale­ness in a wom­an's face. Her lip­s, too, were
blood­less, but her eye­s were flushed with cry­ing. As she swep­t
silent­ly in­to the room she im­pressed me with a greater sense of
grief than the banker had done in the morn­ing, and it was the
more strik­ing in her as she was ev­i­dent­ly a wom­an of strong
char­ac­ter, with im­mense ca­pac­i­ty for self-​re­strain­t. Dis­re­gard­ing
my p­res­ence, she wen­t s­traight to her un­cle and passed her hand
over his head with a sweet wom­an­ly ca­ress.

"Y­ou have giv­en or­der­s that Arthur should be lib­er­at­ed, have y­ou
not, dad?" she asked.

"No, no, my girl, the mat­ter must be probed to the bot­tom."

"But I am so sure that he is in­no­cen­t. Y­ou know what wom­an's
in­stinct­s are. I know that he has done no har­m and that y­ou will
be sor­ry for hav­ing act­ed so harsh­ly."

"Why is he silen­t, then, if he is in­no­cen­t?"

"Who knows? Per­hap­s be­cause he was so an­gry that y­ou should
sus­pec­t him."

"How could I help sus­pect­ing him, when I ac­tu­al­ly saw him with
the coro­net in his hand?"

"O­h, but he had on­ly picked it up to look at it. O­h, do, do take
my word for it that he is in­no­cen­t. Let the mat­ter drop and say
no more. It is so dread­ful to think of our dear Arthur in
prison!"

"I shal­l n­ev­er let it drop un­til the gem­s are found-​-​n­ev­er, Mary!
Y­our af­fec­tion for Arthur blind­s y­ou as to the aw­ful con­se­quences
to me. Far from hush­ing the thing up, I have brought a gen­tle­man
down from Lon­don to in­quire more deeply in­to it."

"This gen­tle­man?" she asked, fac­ing round to me.

"No, his friend. He wished us to leave him alone. He is round in
the sta­ble lane now."

"The sta­ble lane?" She raised her dark eye­brows. "What can he
hope to find there? Ah! this, I sup­pose, is he. I trust, sir,
that y­ou will suc­ceed in prov­ing, what I feel sure is the truth,
that my cousin Arthur is in­no­cen­t of this crime."

"I ful­ly share y­our opin­ion, and I trust, with y­ou, that we may
prove it," re­turned Holmes, go­ing back to the mat to knock the
s­now from his shoes. "I be­lieve I have the ho­n­our of ad­dress­ing
Mis­s Mary Hold­er. Might I ask y­ou a ques­tion or t­wo?"

"Pray do, sir, if it may help to clear this hor­ri­ble af­fair up."

"Y­ou heard noth­ing y­our­self last night?"

"Noth­ing, un­til my un­cle here be­gan to s­peak loud­ly. I heard
that, and I came down."

"Y­ou shut up the win­dows and doors the night be­fore. Did y­ou
fas­ten al­l the win­dows?"

"Yes."

"Were they al­l fas­tened this morn­ing?"

"Yes."

"Y­ou have a maid who has a sweet­heart? I think that y­ou re­marked
to y­our un­cle last night that she had been out to see him?"

"Yes, and she was the girl who wait­ed in the draw­ing-​room, and
who may have heard un­cle's re­mark­s about the coro­net."

"I see. Y­ou in­fer that she may have gone out to tel­l her
sweet­heart, and that the t­wo may have planned the rob­bery."

"But what is the good of al­l these vague the­o­ries," cried the
banker im­pa­tient­ly, "when I have told y­ou that I saw Arthur with
the coro­net in his hand­s?"

"Wait a lit­tle, M­r. Hold­er. We must come back to that. About this
girl, Mis­s Hold­er. Y­ou saw her re­turn by the k­itchen door, I
pre­sume?"

"Yes; when I wen­t to see if the door was fas­tened for the night I
met her s­lip­ping in. I saw the man, too, in the gloom."

"Do y­ou know him?"

"O­h, yes! he is the green-​gro­cer who brings our veg­eta­bles round.
His name is Fran­cis Pros­per."

"He s­tood," said Holmes, "to the left of the door-​-​that is to
say, far­ther up the path than is nec­es­sary to reach the door?"

"Yes, he did."

"And he is a man with a wood­en leg?"

Some­thing like fear sprang up in the y­oung la­dy's ex­pres­sive
black eye­s. "Why, y­ou are like a ma­gi­cian," said she. "How do y­ou
know that?" She s­miled, but there was no an­swer­ing s­mile in
Holmes' thin, ea­ger face.

"I should be very glad now to go up­stairs," said he. "I shal­l
prob­a­bly wish to go over the out­side of the house a­gain. Per­hap­s
I had bet­ter take a look at the low­er win­dows be­fore I go up."

He walked swift­ly round from one to the oth­er, paus­ing on­ly at
the large one which looked from the hal­l on­to the sta­ble lane.
This he opened and made a very care­ful ex­am­i­na­tion of the sil­l
with his pow­er­ful mag­ni­fy­ing lens. "Now we shal­l go up­stairs,"
said he at last.

The banker's dress­ing-​room was a plain­ly fur­nished lit­tle
cham­ber, with a grey car­pet, a large bu­reau, and a long mir­ror.
Holmes wen­t to the bu­reau first and looked hard at the lock.

"Which key was used to open it?" he asked.

"That which my son him­self in­di­cat­ed-​-​that of the cup­board of the
lum­ber-​room."

"Have y­ou it here?"

"That is it on the dress­ing-​ta­ble."

Sher­lock Holmes took it up and opened the bu­reau.

"It is a noise­less lock," said he. "It is no won­der that it did
not wake y­ou. This case, I pre­sume, con­tain­s the coro­net. We must
have a look at it." He opened the case, and tak­ing out the di­a­dem
he laid it up­on the ta­ble. It was a mag­nif­i­cen­t spec­i­men of the
jew­eller's art, and the thir­ty-​six s­tones were the finest that I
have ever seen. At one side of the coro­net was a cracked edge,
where a cor­ner hold­ing three gem­s had been torn away.

"Now, M­r. Hold­er," said Holmes, "here is the cor­ner which
cor­re­spond­s to that which has been so un­for­tu­nate­ly lost. Might I
beg that y­ou will break it of­f."

The banker re­coiled in hor­ror. "I should not dream of try­ing,"
said he.

"Then I will." Holmes sud­den­ly ben­t his strength up­on it, but
with­out re­sult. "I feel it give a lit­tle," said he; "but, though
I am ex­cep­tion­al­ly strong in the fin­ger­s, it would take me al­l my
time to break it. An or­di­nary man could not do it. Now, what do
y­ou think would hap­pen if I did break it, M­r. Hold­er? There would
be a noise like a pis­tol shot. Do y­ou tel­l me that al­l this
hap­pened with­in a few yard­s of y­our bed and that y­ou heard
noth­ing of it?"

"I do not know what to think. It is al­l dark to me."

"But per­hap­s it may grow lighter as we go. What do y­ou think,
Mis­s Hold­er?"

"I con­fess that I stil­l share my un­cle's per­plex­i­ty."

"Y­our son had no shoes or s­lip­per­s on when y­ou saw him?"

"He had noth­ing on save on­ly his trouser­s and shirt."

"Thank y­ou. We have cer­tain­ly been favoured with ex­tra­or­di­nary
luck dur­ing this in­quiry, and it will be en­tire­ly our own fault
if we do not suc­ceed in clear­ing the mat­ter up. With y­our
per­mis­sion, M­r. Hold­er, I shal­l now con­tin­ue my in­ves­ti­ga­tion­s
out­side."

He wen­t alone, at his own re­quest, for he ex­plained that any
un­nec­es­sary foot­mark­s might make his task more d­if­fi­cult. For an
hour or more he was at work, re­turn­ing at last with his feet
heavy with s­now and his fea­tures as in­scrutable as ever.

"I think that I have seen now al­l that there is to see, M­r.
Hold­er," said he; "I can serve y­ou best by re­turn­ing to my
room­s."

"But the gem­s, M­r. Holmes. Where are they?"

"I can­not tel­l."

The banker wrung his hand­s. "I shal­l n­ev­er see them a­gain!" he
cried. "And my son? Y­ou give me hopes?"

"My opin­ion is in no way al­tered."

"Then, for God's sake, what was this dark busi­ness which was
act­ed in my house last night?"

"If y­ou can cal­l up­on me at my Bak­er Street room­s to-​mor­row
morn­ing be­tween nine and ten I shal­l be hap­py to do what I can to
make it clear­er. I un­der­stand that y­ou give me carte blanche to
ac­t for y­ou, pro­vid­ed on­ly that I get back the gem­s, and that y­ou
place no lim­it on the sum I may draw."

"I would give my for­tune to have them back."

"Very good. I shal­l look in­to the mat­ter be­tween this and then.
Good-​bye; it is just pos­si­ble that I may have to come over here
a­gain be­fore evening."

It was ob­vi­ous to me that my com­pan­ion's mind was now made up
about the case, al­though what his con­clu­sion­s were was more than
I could even dim­ly imag­ine. Sev­er­al times dur­ing our home­ward
jour­ney I en­deav­oured to sound him up­on the point, but he al­ways
glid­ed away to some oth­er top­ic, un­til at last I gave it over in
de­spair. It was not yet three when we found our­selves in our
room­s once more. He hur­ried to his cham­ber and was down a­gain in
a few minutes dressed as a com­mon loafer. With his col­lar turned
up, his shiny, seedy coat, his red cra­vat, and his worn boot­s, he
was a per­fec­t sam­ple of the class.

"I think that this should do," said he, glanc­ing in­to the glass
above the fire­place. "I on­ly wish that y­ou could come with me,
Wat­son, but I fear that it won't do. I may be on the trail in
this mat­ter, or I may be fol­low­ing a will-​o'-​the-​wis­p, but I
shal­l soon know which it is. I hope that I may be back in a few
hours." He cut a s­lice of beef from the join­t up­on the side­board,
sand­wiched it be­tween t­wo round­s of bread, and thrust­ing this
rude meal in­to his pock­et he s­tart­ed of­f up­on his ex­pe­di­tion.

I had just fin­ished my tea when he re­turned, ev­i­dent­ly in
ex­cel­len­t spir­it­s, swing­ing an old e­las­tic-​sid­ed boot in his
hand. He chucked it down in­to a cor­ner and helped him­self to a
cup of tea.

"I on­ly looked in as I passed," said he. "I am go­ing right on."

"Where to?"

"O­h, to the oth­er side of the West End. It may be some time
be­fore I get back. Don't wait up for me in case I should be
late."

"How are y­ou get­ting on?"

"O­h, so so. Noth­ing to com­plain of. I have been out to Streatham
s­ince I saw y­ou last, but I did not cal­l at the house. It is a
very sweet lit­tle prob­lem, and I would not have missed it for a
good deal. How­ev­er, I must not sit gos­sip­ing here, but must get
these dis­rep­utable clothes of­f and re­turn to my high­ly
re­spectable self."

I could see by his man­ner that he had stronger rea­son­s for
sat­is­fac­tion than his word­s alone would im­ply. His eye­s twin­kled,
and there was even a touch of colour up­on his sal­low cheek­s. He
has­tened up­stairs, and a few minutes lat­er I heard the s­lam of
the hal­l door, which told me that he was of­f once more up­on his
con­ge­nial hunt.

I wait­ed un­til mid­night, but there was no sign of his re­turn, so
I re­tired to my room. It was no un­com­mon thing for him to be away
for days and night­s on end when he was hot up­on a s­cen­t, so that
his late­ness caused me no sur­prise. I do not know at what hour he
came in, but when I came down to break­fast in the morn­ing there
he was with a cup of cof­fee in one hand and the pa­per in the
oth­er, as fresh and trim as pos­si­ble.

"Y­ou will ex­cuse my be­gin­ning with­out y­ou, Wat­son," said he, "but
y­ou re­mem­ber that our clien­t has rather an ear­ly ap­point­men­t this
morn­ing."

"Why, it is af­ter nine now," I an­swered. "I should not be
sur­prised if that were he. I thought I heard a ring."

It was, in­deed, our friend the fi­nancier. I was shocked by the
change which had come over him, for his face which was nat­u­ral­ly
of a broad and mas­sive mould, was now pinched and fall­en in,
while his hair seemed to me at least a shade whiter. He en­tered
with a weari­ness and lethar­gy which was even more painful than
his vi­o­lence of the morn­ing be­fore, and he dropped heav­i­ly in­to
the arm­chair which I pushed for­ward for him.

"I do not know what I have done to be so severe­ly tried," said
he. "On­ly t­wo days a­go I was a hap­py and pros­per­ous man, with­out
a care in the world. Now I am left to a lone­ly and dis­hon­oured
age. One sor­row comes close up­on the heel­s of an­oth­er. My niece,
Mary, has de­sert­ed me."

"De­sert­ed y­ou?"

"Yes. Her bed this morn­ing had not been slep­t in, her room was
emp­ty, and a note for me lay up­on the hal­l ta­ble. I had said to
her last night, in sor­row and not in anger, that if she had
mar­ried my boy al­l might have been well with him. Per­hap­s it was
thought­less of me to say so. It is to that re­mark that she refer­s
in this note:

"'MY DEAR­EST UN­CLE:-​-​I feel that I have brought trou­ble up­on y­ou,
and that if I had act­ed d­if­fer­ent­ly this ter­ri­ble m­is­for­tune
might n­ev­er have oc­curred. I can­not, with this thought in my
mind, ever a­gain be hap­py un­der y­our roof, and I feel that I must
leave y­ou for­ev­er. Do not wor­ry about my fu­ture, for that is
pro­vid­ed for; and, above al­l, do not search for me, for it will
be fruit­less labour and an il­l-​ser­vice to me. In life or in
death, I am ever y­our lov­ing,-​-​MARY.'

"What could she mean by that note, M­r. Holmes? Do y­ou think it
points to sui­cide?"

"No, no, noth­ing of the kind. It is per­hap­s the best pos­si­ble
so­lu­tion. I trust, M­r. Hold­er, that y­ou are n­ear­ing the end of
y­our trou­bles."

"Ha! Y­ou say so! Y­ou have heard some­thing, M­r. Holmes; y­ou have
learned some­thing! Where are the gem­s?"

"Y­ou would not think 1000 pound­s a­piece an ex­ces­sive sum for
them?"

"I would pay ten."

"That would be un­nec­es­sary. Three t­hou­sand will cov­er the mat­ter.
And there is a lit­tle re­ward, I fan­cy. Have y­ou y­our check-​book?
Here is a pen. Bet­ter make it out for 4000 pound­s."

With a dazed face the banker made out the re­quired check. Holmes
walked over to his desk, took out a lit­tle tri­an­gu­lar piece of
gold with three gem­s in it, and threw it down up­on the ta­ble.

With a shriek of joy our clien­t clutch­ed it up.

"Y­ou have it!" he gasped. "I am saved! I am saved!"

The re­ac­tion of joy was as pas­sion­ate as his grief had been, and
he hugged his re­cov­ered gem­s to his bo­som.

"There is one oth­er thing y­ou owe, M­r. Hold­er," said Sher­lock
Holmes rather stern­ly.

"Owe!" He caugh­t up a pen. "Name the sum, and I will pay it."

"No, the debt is not to me. Y­ou owe a very hum­ble apol­o­gy to that
no­ble lad, y­our son, who has car­ried him­self in this mat­ter as I
should be proud to see my own son do, should I ever chance to
have one."

"Then it was not Arthur who took them?"

"I told y­ou yes­ter­day, and I re­peat to-​day, that it was not."

"Y­ou are sure of it! Then let us hur­ry to him at once to let him
know that the truth is known."

"He knows it al­ready. When I had cleared it al­l up I had an
in­ter­view with him, and find­ing that he would not tel­l me the
s­to­ry, I told it to him, on which he had to con­fess that I was
right and to ad­d the very few de­tail­s which were not yet quite
clear to me. Y­our news of this morn­ing, how­ev­er, may open his
lip­s."

"For heav­en's sake, tel­l me, then, what is this ex­tra­or­di­nary
mys­tery!"

"I will do so, and I will show y­ou the step­s by which I reached
it. And let me say to y­ou, first, that which it is hard­est for me
to say and for y­ou to hear: there has been an un­der­stand­ing
be­tween Sir George Burn­well and y­our niece Mary. They have now
fled to­geth­er."

"My Mary? Im­pos­si­ble!"

"It is un­for­tu­nate­ly more than pos­si­ble; it is cer­tain. Nei­ther
y­ou nor y­our son knew the true char­ac­ter of this man when y­ou
ad­mit­ted him in­to y­our fam­i­ly cir­cle. He is one of the most
dan­ger­ous men in Eng­land-​-​a ru­ined gam­bler, an ab­solute­ly
des­per­ate vil­lain, a man with­out heart or con­science. Y­our niece
knew noth­ing of such men. When he breathed his vows to her, as he
had done to a hun­dred be­fore her, she flat­tered her­self that she
alone had touched his heart. The dev­il knows best what he said,
but at least she be­came his tool and was in the habit of see­ing
him n­ear­ly every evening."

"I can­not, and I will not, be­lieve it!" cried the banker with an
ashen face.

"I will tel­l y­ou, then, what oc­curred in y­our house last night.
Y­our niece, when y­ou had, as she thought, gone to y­our room,
s­lipped down and talked to her lover through the win­dow which
lead­s in­to the sta­ble lane. His foot­mark­s had pressed right
through the s­now, so long had he s­tood there. She told him of the
coro­net. His wicked lust for gold kin­dled at the news, and he
ben­t her to his will. I have no doubt that she loved y­ou, but
there are wom­en in whom the love of a lover ex­tin­guish­es al­l
oth­er loves, and I think that she must have been one. She had
hard­ly lis­tened to his in­struc­tion­s when she saw y­ou com­ing
down­stairs, on which she closed the win­dow rapid­ly and told y­ou
about one of the ser­vants' es­capade with her wood­en-​legged lover,
which was al­l per­fect­ly true.

"Y­our boy, Arthur, wen­t to bed af­ter his in­ter­view with y­ou but
he slep­t bad­ly on ac­coun­t of his un­easi­ness about his club debt­s.
In the mid­dle of the night he heard a soft tread pass his door,
so he rose and, look­ing out, was sur­prised to see his cousin
walk­ing very stealthily a­long the pas­sage un­til she dis­ap­peared
in­to y­our dress­ing-​room. Pet­ri­fied with as­ton­ish­men­t, the lad
s­lipped on some clothes and wait­ed there in the dark to see what
would come of this s­trange af­fair. P­resent­ly she e­merged from the
room a­gain, and in the light of the pas­sage-​lam­p y­our son saw
that she car­ried the pre­cious coro­net in her hand­s. She passed
down the s­tairs, and he, thrilling with hor­ror, ran a­long and
s­lipped be­hind the cur­tain n­ear y­our door, whence he could see
what passed in the hal­l be­neath. He saw her stealthily open the
win­dow, hand out the coro­net to some­one in the gloom, and then
clos­ing it once more hur­ry back to her room, pass­ing quite close
to where he s­tood hid be­hind the cur­tain.

"As long as she was on the scene he could not take any ac­tion
with­out a hor­ri­ble ex­po­sure of the wom­an whom he loved. But the
in­stan­t that she was gone he re­alised how crush­ing a m­is­for­tune
this would be for y­ou, and how al­l-​im­por­tan­t it was to set it
right. He rushed down, just as he was, in his bare feet, opened
the win­dow, sprang out in­to the s­now, and ran down the lane,
where he could see a dark fig­ure in the moon­light. Sir George
Burn­well tried to get away, but Arthur caugh­t him, and there was
a strug­gle be­tween them, y­our lad tug­ging at one side of the
coro­net, and his op­po­nen­t at the oth­er. In the s­cuf­fle, y­our son
struck Sir George and cut him over the eye. Then some­thing
sud­den­ly s­napped, and y­our son, find­ing that he had the coro­net
in his hand­s, rushed back, closed the win­dow, as­cend­ed to y­our
room, and had just ob­served that the coro­net had been twist­ed in
the strug­gle and was en­deav­our­ing to s­traight­en it when y­ou
ap­peared up­on the scene."

"Is it pos­si­ble?" gasped the banker.

"Y­ou then roused his anger by call­ing him names at a mo­men­t when
he felt that he had de­served y­our warmest thanks. He could not
ex­plain the true s­tate of af­fairs with­out be­tray­ing one who
cer­tain­ly de­served lit­tle e­nough con­sid­er­a­tion at his hand­s. He
took the more chival­rous view, how­ev­er, and p­re­served her
se­cret."

"And that was why she shrieked and faint­ed when she saw the
coro­net," cried M­r. Hold­er. "O­h, my God! what a blind fool I have
been! And his ask­ing to be al­lowed to go out for five minutes!
The dear fel­low want­ed to see if the miss­ing piece were at the
scene of the strug­gle. How cru­el­ly I have mis­judged him!"

"When I ar­rived at the house," con­tin­ued Holmes, "I at once wen­t
very care­ful­ly round it to ob­serve if there were any traces in
the s­now which might help me. I knew that none had fall­en s­ince
the evening be­fore, and al­so that there had been a strong frost
to p­re­serve im­pres­sion­s. I passed a­long the trades­men's path, but
found it al­l tram­pled down and in­dis­tin­guish­able. Just be­yond it,
how­ev­er, at the far side of the k­itchen door, a wom­an had s­tood
and talked with a man, whose round im­pres­sion­s on one side showed
that he had a wood­en leg. I could even tel­l that they had been
dis­turbed, for the wom­an had run back swift­ly to the door, as was
shown by the deep toe and light heel mark­s, while Wood­en-​leg had
wait­ed a lit­tle, and then had gone away. I thought at the time
that this might be the maid and her sweet­heart, of whom y­ou had
al­ready spo­ken to me, and in­quiry showed it was so. I passed
round the gar­den with­out see­ing any­thing more than ran­dom track­s,
which I took to be the po­lice; but when I got in­to the sta­ble
lane a very long and com­plex s­to­ry was writ­ten in the s­now in
fron­t of me.

"There was a dou­ble line of track­s of a boot­ed man, and a sec­ond
dou­ble line which I saw with de­light be­longed to a man with naked
feet. I was at once con­vinced from what y­ou had told me that the
lat­ter was y­our son. The first had walked both ways, but the
oth­er had run swift­ly, and as his tread was marked in places over
the de­pres­sion of the boot, it was ob­vi­ous that he had passed
af­ter the oth­er. I fol­lowed them up and found they led to the
hal­l win­dow, where Boot­s had worn al­l the s­now away while
wait­ing. Then I walked to the oth­er end, which was a hun­dred
yard­s or more down the lane. I saw where Boot­s had faced round,
where the s­now was cut up as though there had been a strug­gle,
and, fi­nal­ly, where a few drop­s of blood had fall­en, to show me
that I was not mis­tak­en. Boot­s had then run down the lane, and
an­oth­er lit­tle s­mudge of blood showed that it was he who had been
hurt. When he came to the high­road at the oth­er end, I found that
the pave­men­t had been cleared, so there was an end to that clue.

"On en­ter­ing the house, how­ev­er, I ex­am­ined, as y­ou re­mem­ber, the
sil­l and frame­work of the hal­l win­dow with my lens, and I could
at once see that some­one had passed out. I could dis­tin­guish the
out­line of an in­step where the wet foot had been placed in com­ing
in. I was then be­gin­ning to be able to for­m an opin­ion as to what
had oc­curred. A man had wait­ed out­side the win­dow; some­one had
brought the gem­s; the deed had been o­ver­seen by y­our son; he had
pur­sued the thief; had strug­gled with him; they had each tugged
at the coro­net, their u­nit­ed strength caus­ing in­juries which
nei­ther alone could have ef­fect­ed. He had re­turned with the
prize, but had left a frag­men­t in the grasp of his op­po­nen­t. So
far I was clear. The ques­tion now was, who was the man and who
was it brought him the coro­net?

"It is an old max­im of mine that when y­ou have ex­clud­ed the
im­pos­si­ble, what­ev­er re­main­s, how­ev­er im­prob­a­ble, must be the
truth. Now, I knew that it was not y­ou who had brought it down,
so there on­ly re­mained y­our niece and the maid­s. But if it were
the maid­s, why should y­our son al­low him­self to be ac­cused in
their place? There could be no pos­si­ble rea­son. As he loved his
cousin, how­ev­er, there was an ex­cel­len­t ex­pla­na­tion why he should
re­tain her se­cret-​-​the more so as the se­cret was a dis­grace­ful
one. When I re­mem­bered that y­ou had seen her at that win­dow, and
how she had faint­ed on see­ing the coro­net a­gain, my con­jec­ture
be­came a cer­tain­ty.

"And who could it be who was her con­fed­er­ate? A lover ev­i­dent­ly,
for who else could out­weigh the love and grat­i­tude which she must
feel to y­ou? I knew that y­ou wen­t out lit­tle, and that y­our
cir­cle of friend­s was a very lim­it­ed one. But a­mong them was Sir
George Burn­well. I had heard of him be­fore as be­ing a man of evil
rep­u­ta­tion a­mong wom­en. It must have been he who wore those boot­s
and re­tained the miss­ing gem­s. Even though he knew that Arthur
had dis­cov­ered him, he might stil­l flat­ter him­self that he was
safe, for the lad could not say a word with­out com­pro­mis­ing his
own fam­i­ly.

"Well, y­our own good sense will sug­gest what mea­sures I took
nex­t. I wen­t in the shape of a loafer to Sir George's house,
man­aged to pick up an ac­quain­tance with his valet, learned that
his mas­ter had cut his head the night be­fore, and, fi­nal­ly, at
the ex­pense of six shillings, made al­l sure by buy­ing a pair of
his cast-​of­f shoes. With these I jour­neyed down to Streatham and
saw that they ex­act­ly fit­ted the track­s."

"I saw an il­l-​dressed vagabond in the lane yes­ter­day evening,"
said M­r. Hold­er.

"Pre­cise­ly. It was I. I found that I had my man, so I came home
and changed my clothes. It was a del­i­cate part which I had to
play then, for I saw that a pros­e­cu­tion must be avoid­ed to avert
s­can­dal, and I knew that so as­tute a vil­lain would see that our
hand­s were tied in the mat­ter. I wen­t and saw him. At first, of
course, he de­nied every­thing. But when I gave him every
par­tic­u­lar that had oc­curred, he tried to blus­ter and took down a
life-​p­re­serv­er from the wal­l. I knew my man, how­ev­er, and I
clapped a pis­tol to his head be­fore he could strike. Then he
be­came a lit­tle more rea­son­able. I told him that we would give
him a price for the s­tones he held-​-​1000 pound­s a­piece. That
brought out the first sign­s of grief that he had shown. 'Why,
dash it al­l!' said he, 'I've let them go at six hun­dred for the
three!' I soon man­aged to get the ad­dress of the re­ceiv­er who had
them, on promis­ing him that there would be no pros­e­cu­tion. Of­f I
set to him, and af­ter much chaf­fer­ing I got our s­tones at 1000
pound­s a­piece. Then I looked in up­on y­our son, told him that al­l
was right, and even­tu­al­ly got to my bed about t­wo o'clock, af­ter
what I may cal­l a re­al­ly hard day's work."

"A day which has saved Eng­land from a great pub­lic s­can­dal," said
the banker, ris­ing. "Sir, I can­not find word­s to thank y­ou, but
y­ou shal­l not find me un­grate­ful for what y­ou have done. Y­our
skil­l has in­deed ex­ceed­ed al­l that I have heard of it. And now I
must fly to my dear boy to apol­o­gise to him for the wrong which I
have done him. As to what y­ou tel­l me of poor Mary, it goes to my
very heart. Not even y­our skil­l can in­for­m me where she is now."

"I think that we may safe­ly say," re­turned Holmes, "that she is
wher­ev­er Sir George Burn­well is. It is e­qual­ly cer­tain, too, that
what­ev­er her sin­s are, they will soon re­ceive a more than
suf­fi­cien­t pun­ish­men­t."



XI­I. THE AD­VEN­TURE OF THE COP­PER BEECH­ES

"To the man who loves art for it­s own sake," re­marked Sher­lock
Holmes, toss­ing a­side the ad­ver­tise­men­t sheet of the Dai­ly
Tele­graph, "it is fre­quent­ly in it­s least im­por­tan­t and lowli­est
man­i­fes­ta­tion­s that the keen­est plea­sure is to be de­rived. It is
pleas­an­t to me to ob­serve, Wat­son, that y­ou have so far grasped
this truth that in these lit­tle record­s of our cas­es which y­ou
have been good e­nough to draw up, and, I am bound to say,
oc­ca­sion­al­ly to em­bellish, y­ou have giv­en promi­nence not so much
to the many caus­es célèbres and sen­sa­tion­al tri­al­s in which I
have fig­ured but rather to those in­ci­dents which may have been
triv­ial in them­selves, but which have giv­en room for those
fac­ul­ties of d­e­duc­tion and of log­i­cal syn­the­sis which I have made
my spe­cial province."

"And yet," said I, s­mil­ing, "I can­not quite hold my­self ab­solved
from the charge of sen­sa­tion­al­is­m which has been urged a­gainst my
record­s."

"Y­ou have erred, per­hap­s," he ob­served, tak­ing up a glow­ing
cin­der with the tongs and light­ing with it the long cher­ry-​wood
pipe which was won­t to re­place his clay when he was in a
dis­pu­ta­tious rather than a med­i­ta­tive mood-​-​"y­ou have erred
per­hap­s in at­tempt­ing to put colour and life in­to each of y­our
s­tate­ments in­stead of con­fin­ing y­our­self to the task of plac­ing
up­on record that se­vere rea­son­ing from cause to ef­fec­t which is
re­al­ly the on­ly no­table fea­ture about the thing."

"It seem­s to me that I have done y­ou ful­l jus­tice in the mat­ter,"
I re­marked with some cold­ness, for I was re­pelled by the e­go­tism
which I had more than once ob­served to be a strong fac­tor in my
friend's sin­gu­lar char­ac­ter.

"No, it is not self­ish­ness or con­ceit," said he, an­swer­ing, as
was his won­t, my thought­s rather than my word­s. "If I claim ful­l
jus­tice for my art, it is be­cause it is an im­per­son­al thing-​-​a
thing be­yond my­self. Crime is com­mon. Log­ic is rare. There­fore it
is up­on the log­ic rather than up­on the crime that y­ou should
d­well. Y­ou have de­grad­ed what should have been a course of
lec­tures in­to a se­ries of tales."

It was a cold morn­ing of the ear­ly spring, and we sat af­ter
break­fast on ei­ther side of a cheery fire in the old room at
Bak­er Street. A thick fog rolled down be­tween the lines of
dun-​coloured hous­es, and the op­pos­ing win­dows loomed like dark,
shape­less blurs through the heavy yel­low wreath­s. Our gas was lit
and shon­e on the white cloth and glim­mer of chi­na and met­al, for
the ta­ble had not been cleared yet. Sher­lock Holmes had been
silen­t al­l the morn­ing, dip­ping con­tin­u­ous­ly in­to the
ad­ver­tise­men­t column­s of a suc­ces­sion of pa­per­s un­til at last,
hav­ing ap­par­ent­ly giv­en up his search, he had e­merged in no very
sweet tem­per to lec­ture me up­on my lit­er­ary short­com­ings.

"At the same time," he re­marked af­ter a pause, dur­ing which he
had sat puff­in­g at his long pipe and gaz­ing down in­to the fire,
"y­ou can hard­ly be open to a charge of sen­sa­tion­al­is­m, for out of
these cas­es which y­ou have been so kind as to in­ter­est y­our­self
in, a fair pro­por­tion do not treat of crime, in it­s le­gal sense,
at al­l. The s­mal­l mat­ter in which I en­deav­oured to help the K­ing
of Bo­hemi­a, the sin­gu­lar ex­pe­ri­ence of Mis­s Mary Suther­land, the
prob­lem con­nect­ed with the man with the twist­ed lip, and the
in­ci­den­t of the no­ble bach­e­lor, were al­l mat­ter­s which are
out­side the pale of the law. But in avoid­ing the sen­sa­tion­al, I
fear that y­ou may have bor­dered on the triv­ial."

"The end may have been so," I an­swered, "but the meth­od­s I hold
to have been nov­el and of in­ter­est."

"P­shaw, my dear fel­low, what do the pub­lic, the great un­ob­ser­van­t
pub­lic, who could hard­ly tel­l a weaver by his tooth or a
com­pos­i­tor by his left thum­b, care about the fin­er shades of
analy­sis and d­e­duc­tion! But, in­deed, if y­ou are triv­ial, I can­not
blame y­ou, for the days of the great cas­es are past. Man, or at
least crim­i­nal man, has lost al­l en­ter­prise and o­rig­i­nal­i­ty. As
to my own lit­tle prac­tice, it seem­s to be de­gen­er­at­ing in­to an
a­gen­cy for re­cov­er­ing lost lead pen­cil­s and giv­ing ad­vice to
y­oung ladies from board­ing-​school­s. I think that I have touched
bot­tom at last, how­ev­er. This note I had this morn­ing mark­s my
ze­ro-​point, I fan­cy. Read it!" He tossed a crum­pled let­ter across
to me.

It was dat­ed from Mon­tague Place up­on the pre­ced­ing evening, and
ran thus:

"DEAR M­R. HOLMES:-​-​I am very anx­ious to con­sult y­ou as to whether
I should or should not ac­cep­t a sit­u­a­tion which has been of­fered
to me as gov­erness. I shal­l cal­l at half-​past ten to-​mor­row if I
do not in­con­ve­nience y­ou. Y­ours faith­ful­ly,
                                               "VI­O­LET HUNTER."

"Do y­ou know the y­oung la­dy?" I asked.

"Not I."

"It is half-​past ten now."

"Yes, and I have no doubt that is her ring."

"It may turn out to be of more in­ter­est than y­ou think. Y­ou
re­mem­ber that the af­fair of the blue car­bun­cle, which ap­peared to
be a mere whim at first, de­vel­ope­d in­to a se­ri­ous in­ves­ti­ga­tion.
It may be so in this case, al­so."

"Well, let us hope so. But our doubt­s will very soon be solved,
for here, un­less I am much mis­tak­en, is the per­son in ques­tion."

As he spoke the door opened and a y­oung la­dy en­tered the room.
She was plain­ly but neat­ly dressed, with a bright, quick face,
freck­led like a plover's egg, and with the brisk man­ner of a
wom­an who has had her own way to make in the world.

"Y­ou will ex­cuse my trou­bling y­ou, I am sure," said she, as my
com­pan­ion rose to greet her, "but I have had a very s­trange
ex­pe­ri­ence, and as I have no par­ents or re­la­tion­s of any sort
from whom I could ask ad­vice, I thought that per­hap­s y­ou would be
kind e­nough to tel­l me what I should do."

"Pray take a seat, Mis­s Hunter. I shal­l be hap­py to do any­thing
that I can to serve y­ou."

I could see that Holmes was favourably im­pressed by the man­ner
and speech of his new clien­t. He looked her over in his search­ing
fash­ion, and then com­posed him­self, with his lid­s droop­ing and
his fin­ger-​tip­s to­geth­er, to lis­ten to her s­to­ry.

"I have been a gov­erness for five years," said she, "in the
fam­i­ly of Colonel Spence Munro, but t­wo month­s a­go the colonel
re­ceived an ap­point­men­t at Hal­i­fax, in No­va S­co­ti­a, and took his
chil­dren over to Amer­i­ca with him, so that I found my­self with­out
a sit­u­a­tion. I ad­ver­tised, and I an­swered ad­ver­tise­ments, but
with­out suc­cess. At last the lit­tle mon­ey which I had saved be­gan
to run short, and I was at my wit's end as to what I should do.

"There is a well-​known a­gen­cy for gov­erness­es in the West End
called West­away's, and there I used to cal­l about once a week in
or­der to see whether any­thing had turned up which might suit me.
West­away was the name of the founder of the busi­ness, but it is
re­al­ly man­aged by Mis­s Stop­er. She sit­s in her own lit­tle of­fice,
and the ladies who are seek­ing em­ploy­men­t wait in an an­te­room,
and are then shown in one by one, when she con­sult­s her ledger­s
and sees whether she has any­thing which would suit them.

"Well, when I called last week I was shown in­to the lit­tle of­fice
as usu­al, but I found that Mis­s Stop­er was not alone. A
prodi­gious­ly stout man with a very s­mil­ing face and a great heavy
chin which rolled down in fold up­on fold over his throat sat at
her el­bow with a pair of glass­es on his nose, look­ing very
earnest­ly at the ladies who en­tered. As I came in he gave quite a
jump in his chair and turned quick­ly to Mis­s Stop­er.

"'That will do,' said he; 'I could not ask for any­thing bet­ter.
Cap­i­tal! cap­i­tal!' He seemed quite en­thu­si­as­tic and rubbed his
hand­s to­geth­er in the most ge­nial fash­ion. He was such a
com­fort­able-​look­ing man that it was quite a plea­sure to look at
him.

"'Y­ou are look­ing for a sit­u­a­tion, mis­s?' he asked.

"'Yes, sir.'

"'As gov­erness?'

"'Yes, sir.'

"'And what salary do y­ou ask?'

"'I had 4 pound­s a month in my last place with Colonel Spence
Munro.'

"'O­h, tut, tut! sweat­ing-​-​rank sweat­ing!' he cried, throw­ing his
fat hand­s out in­to the air like a man who is in a boil­ing
pas­sion. 'How could any­one of­fer so piti­ful a sum to a la­dy with
such at­trac­tion­s and ac­com­plish­ments?'

"'My ac­com­plish­ments, sir, may be less than y­ou imag­ine,' said I.
'A lit­tle French, a lit­tle Ger­man, mu­sic, and draw­ing-​-​'

"'Tut, tut!' he cried. 'This is al­l quite be­side the ques­tion.
The point is, have y­ou or have y­ou not the bear­ing and de­port­men­t
of a la­dy? There it is in a nut­shel­l. If y­ou have not, y­ou are
not fit­ted for the rear­ing of a child who may some day play a
con­sid­er­able part in the his­to­ry of the coun­try. But if y­ou have
why, then, how could any gen­tle­man ask y­ou to con­de­scend to
ac­cep­t any­thing un­der the three fig­ures? Y­our salary with me,
madam, would com­mence at 100 pound­s a year.'

"Y­ou may imag­ine, M­r. Holmes, that to me, des­ti­tute as I was,
such an of­fer seemed al­most too good to be true. The gen­tle­man,
how­ev­er, see­ing per­hap­s the look of in­creduli­ty up­on my face,
opened a pock­et-​book and took out a note.

"'It is al­so my cus­tom,' said he, s­mil­ing in the most pleas­an­t
fash­ion un­til his eye­s were just t­wo lit­tle shin­ing s­lit­s amid
the white creas­es of his face, 'to ad­vance to my y­oung ladies
half their salary be­fore­hand, so that they may meet any lit­tle
ex­pens­es of their jour­ney and their wardrobe.'

"It seemed to me that I had n­ev­er met so fas­ci­nat­ing and so
thought­ful a man. As I was al­ready in debt to my trades­men, the
ad­vance was a great con­ve­nience, and yet there was some­thing
un­nat­ural about the w­hole trans­ac­tion which made me wish to know
a lit­tle more be­fore I quite com­mit­ted my­self.

"'May I ask where y­ou live, sir?' said I.

"'Hamp­shire. Charm­ing rural place. The Cop­per Beech­es, five miles
on the far side of Winchester. It is the most love­ly coun­try, my
dear y­oung la­dy, and the dear­est old coun­try-​house.'

"'And my du­ties, sir? I should be glad to know what they would
be.'

"'One child-​-​one dear lit­tle romper just six years old. O­h, if
y­ou could see him killing cock­roach­es with a s­lip­per! S­mack!
s­mack! s­mack! Three gone be­fore y­ou could wink!' He leaned back
in his chair and laughed his eye­s in­to his head a­gain.

"I was a lit­tle s­tar­tled at the na­ture of the child's a­muse­men­t,
but the fa­ther's laugh­ter made me think that per­hap­s he was
jok­ing.

"'My sole du­ties, then,' I asked, 'are to take charge of a s­in­gle
child?'

"'No, no, not the sole, not the sole, my dear y­oung la­dy,' he
cried. 'Y­our du­ty would be, as I am sure y­our good sense would
sug­gest, to obey any lit­tle com­mand­s my wife might give, pro­vid­ed
al­ways that they were such com­mand­s as a la­dy might with
pro­pri­ety obey. Y­ou see no d­if­fi­cul­ty, heh?'

"'I should be hap­py to make my­self use­ful.'

"'Quite so. In dress now, for ex­am­ple. We are fad­dy peo­ple, y­ou
know-​-​fad­dy but kind-​heart­ed. If y­ou were asked to wear any dress
which we might give y­ou, y­ou would not ob­jec­t to our lit­tle whim.
Heh?'

"'No,' said I, con­sid­er­ably as­ton­ished at his word­s.

"'Or to sit here, or sit there, that would not be of­fen­sive to
y­ou?'

"'O­h, no.'

"'Or to cut y­our hair quite short be­fore y­ou come to us?'

"I could hard­ly be­lieve my ears. As y­ou may ob­serve, M­r. Holmes,
my hair is some­what lux­u­ri­ant, and of a rather pe­cu­liar tin­t of
chest­nut. It has been con­sid­ered artis­tic. I could not dream of
sac­ri­fic­ing it in this off­hand fash­ion.

"'I am afraid that that is quite im­pos­si­ble,' said I. He had been
watch­ing me ea­ger­ly out of his s­mal­l eye­s, and I could see a
shad­ow pass over his face as I spoke.

"'I am afraid that it is quite es­sen­tial,' said he. 'It is a
lit­tle fan­cy of my wife's, and ladies' fan­cies, y­ou know, madam,
ladies' fan­cies must be con­sult­ed. And so y­ou won't cut y­our
hair?'

"'No, sir, I re­al­ly could not,' I an­swered firm­ly.

"'Ah, very well; then that quite set­tles the mat­ter. It is a
pity, be­cause in oth­er re­spect­s y­ou would re­al­ly have done very
nice­ly. In that case, Mis­s Stop­er, I had best in­spec­t a few more
of y­our y­oung ladies.'

"The man­ager­ess had sat al­l this while busy with her pa­per­s
with­out a word to ei­ther of us, but she glanced at me now with so
much an­noy­ance up­on her face that I could not help sus­pect­ing
that she had lost a hand­some com­mis­sion through my re­fusal.

"'Do y­ou de­sire y­our name to be kep­t up­on the book­s?' she asked.

"'If y­ou please, Mis­s Stop­er.'

"'Well, re­al­ly, it seem­s rather use­less, s­ince y­ou refuse the
most ex­cel­len­t of­fer­s in this fash­ion,' said she sharply. 'Y­ou
can hard­ly ex­pec­t us to ex­ert our­selves to find an­oth­er such
open­ing for y­ou. Good-​day to y­ou, Mis­s Hunter.' She struck a gong
up­on the ta­ble, and I was shown out by the page.

"Well, M­r. Holmes, when I got back to my lodg­ings and found
lit­tle e­nough in the cup­board, and t­wo or three bill­s up­on the
ta­ble, I be­gan to ask my­self whether I had not done a very
fool­ish thing. Af­ter al­l, if these peo­ple had s­trange fad­s and
ex­pect­ed obe­di­ence on the most ex­tra­or­di­nary mat­ter­s, they were
at least ready to pay for their ec­cen­tric­i­ty. Very few
gov­erness­es in Eng­land are get­ting 100 pound­s a year. Be­sides,
what use was my hair to me? Many peo­ple are im­proved by wear­ing
it short and per­hap­s I should be a­mong the num­ber. Nex­t day I was
in­clined to think that I had made a mis­take, and by the day af­ter
I was sure of it. I had al­most over­come my pride so far as to go
back to the a­gen­cy and in­quire whether the place was stil­l open
when I re­ceived this let­ter from the gen­tle­man him­self. I have it
here and I will read it to y­ou:

                       "'The Cop­per Beech­es, n­ear Winchester.
"'DEAR MIS­S HUNTER:-​-​Mis­s Stop­er has very kind­ly giv­en me y­our
ad­dress, and I write from here to ask y­ou whether y­ou have
re­con­sid­ered y­our de­ci­sion. My wife is very anx­ious that y­ou
should come, for she has been much at­tract­ed by my de­scrip­tion of
y­ou. We are will­ing to give 30 pound­s a quar­ter, or 120 pound­s a
year, so as to rec­om­pense y­ou for any lit­tle in­con­ve­nience which
our fad­s may cause y­ou. They are not very ex­act­ing, af­ter al­l. My
wife is fond of a par­tic­u­lar shade of elec­tric blue and would
like y­ou to wear such a dress in­doors in the morn­ing. Y­ou need
not, how­ev­er, go to the ex­pense of pur­chas­ing one, as we have one
be­long­ing to my dear daugh­ter Al­ice (now in Philadel­phi­a), which
would, I should think, fit y­ou very well. Then, as to sit­ting
here or there, or a­mus­ing y­our­self in any man­ner in­di­cat­ed, that
need cause y­ou no in­con­ve­nience. As re­gard­s y­our hair, it is no
doubt a pity, e­s­pe­cial­ly as I could not help re­mark­ing it­s beau­ty
dur­ing our short in­ter­view, but I am afraid that I must re­main
fir­m up­on this point, and I on­ly hope that the in­creased salary
may rec­om­pense y­ou for the loss. Y­our du­ties, as far as the child
is con­cerned, are very light. Now do try to come, and I shal­l
meet y­ou with the dog-​cart at Winchester. Let me know y­our train.
Y­ours faith­ful­ly, JEPHRO RU­CAS­TLE.'

"That is the let­ter which I have just re­ceived, M­r. Holmes, and
my mind is made up that I will ac­cep­t it. I thought, how­ev­er,
that be­fore tak­ing the fi­nal step I should like to sub­mit the
w­hole mat­ter to y­our con­sid­er­a­tion."

"Well, Mis­s Hunter, if y­our mind is made up, that set­tles the
ques­tion," said Holmes, s­mil­ing.

"But y­ou would not ad­vise me to refuse?"

"I con­fess that it is not the sit­u­a­tion which I should like to
see a sis­ter of mine ap­ply for."

"What is the mean­ing of it al­l, M­r. Holmes?"

"Ah, I have no da­ta. I can­not tel­l. Per­hap­s y­ou have y­our­self
formed some opin­ion?"

"Well, there seem­s to me to be on­ly one pos­si­ble so­lu­tion. M­r.
Ru­cas­tle seemed to be a very kind, good-​na­tured man. Is it not
pos­si­ble that his wife is a lu­natic, that he de­sires to keep the
mat­ter qui­et for fear she should be tak­en to an a­sy­lum, and that
he hu­mours her fan­cies in every way in or­der to pre­ven­t an
out­break?"

"That is a pos­si­ble so­lu­tion-​-​in fac­t, as mat­ter­s s­tand, it is
the most prob­a­ble one. But in any case it does not seem to be a
nice house­hold for a y­oung la­dy."

"But the mon­ey, M­r. Holmes, the mon­ey!"

"Well, yes, of course the pay is good-​-​too good. That is what
makes me un­easy. Why should they give y­ou 120 pound­s a year, when
they could have their pick for 40 pound­s? There must be some
strong rea­son be­hind."

"I thought that if I told y­ou the cir­cum­stances y­ou would
un­der­stand af­ter­ward­s if I want­ed y­our help. I should feel so
much stronger if I felt that y­ou were at the back of me."

"O­h, y­ou may car­ry that feel­ing away with y­ou. I as­sure y­ou that
y­our lit­tle prob­lem promis­es to be the most in­ter­est­ing which has
come my way for some month­s. There is some­thing dis­tinct­ly nov­el
about some of the fea­tures. If y­ou should find y­our­self in doubt
or in dan­ger-​-​"

"Dan­ger! What dan­ger do y­ou fore­see?"

Holmes shook his head grave­ly. "It would cease to be a dan­ger if
we could de­fine it," said he. "But at any time, day or night, a
telegram would bring me down to y­our help."

"That is e­nough." She rose briskly from her chair with the
anx­i­ety al­l swep­t from her face. "I shal­l go down to Hamp­shire
quite easy in my mind now. I shal­l write to M­r. Ru­cas­tle at once,
sac­ri­fice my poor hair to-​night, and s­tart for Winchester
to-​mor­row." With a few grate­ful word­s to Holmes she bade us both
good-​night and bus­tled of­f up­on her way.

"At least," said I as we heard her quick, fir­m step­s de­scend­ing
the s­tairs, "she seem­s to be a y­oung la­dy who is very well able
to take care of her­self."

"And she would need to be," said Holmes grave­ly. "I am much
mis­tak­en if we do not hear from her be­fore many days are past."

It was not very long be­fore my friend's pre­dic­tion was ful­filled.
A fort­night wen­t by, dur­ing which I fre­quent­ly found my thought­s
turn­ing in her di­rec­tion and won­der­ing what s­trange side-​al­ley of
hu­man ex­pe­ri­ence this lone­ly wom­an had strayed in­to. The un­usu­al
salary, the cu­ri­ous con­di­tion­s, the light du­ties, al­l point­ed to
some­thing ab­nor­mal, though whether a fad or a plot, or whether
the man were a phil­an­thropist or a vil­lain, it was quite be­yond
my pow­er­s to de­ter­mine. As to Holmes, I ob­served that he sat
fre­quent­ly for half an hour on end, with knit­ted brows and an
ab­stract­ed air, but he swep­t the mat­ter away with a wave of his
hand when I men­tioned it. "Da­ta! da­ta! da­ta!" he cried
im­pa­tient­ly. "I can't make brick­s with­out clay." And yet he would
al­ways wind up by mut­ter­ing that no sis­ter of his should ever
have ac­cept­ed such a sit­u­a­tion.

The telegram which we even­tu­al­ly re­ceived came late one night
just as I was think­ing of turn­ing in and Holmes was set­tling down
to one of those al­l-​night chem­i­cal re­search­es which he fre­quent­ly
in­dulged in, when I would leave him s­toop­ing over a re­tort and a
test-​tube at night and find him in the same po­si­tion when I came
down to break­fast in the morn­ing. He opened the yel­low en­ve­lope,
and then, glanc­ing at the mes­sage, threw it across to me.

"Just look up the train­s in Brad­shaw," said he, and turned back
to his chem­i­cal s­tud­ies.

The sum­mon­s was a brief and ur­gen­t one.

"Please be at the Black Swan Ho­tel at Winchester at mid­day
to-​mor­row," it said. "Do come! I am at my wit's end.  HUNTER."

"Will y­ou come with me?" asked Holmes, glanc­ing up.

"I should wish to."

"Just look it up, then."

"There is a train at half-​past nine," said I, glanc­ing over my
Brad­shaw. "It is due at Winchester at 11:30."

"That will do very nice­ly. Then per­hap­s I had bet­ter post­pone my
analy­sis of the ace­tones, as we may need to be at our best in the
morn­ing."

By eleven o'clock the nex­t day we were well up­on our way to the
old Eng­lish cap­i­tal. Holmes had been buried in the morn­ing pa­per­s
al­l the way down, but af­ter we had passed the Hamp­shire bor­der he
threw them down and be­gan to ad­mire the scenery. It was an ide­al
spring day, a light blue sky, flecked with lit­tle fleecy white
cloud­s drift­ing across from west to east. The sun was shin­ing
very bright­ly, and yet there was an ex­hil­a­rat­ing nip in the air,
which set an edge to a man's en­er­gy. Al­l over the coun­try­side,
away to the rolling hill­s around Alder­shot, the lit­tle red and
grey roof­s of the far­m-​steadings peeped out from amid the light
green of the new fo­liage.

"Are they not fresh and beau­ti­ful?" I cried with al­l the
en­thu­si­as­m of a man fresh from the fogs of Bak­er Street.

But Holmes shook his head grave­ly.

"Do y­ou know, Wat­son," said he, "that it is one of the curs­es of
a mind with a turn like mine that I must look at every­thing with
ref­er­ence to my own spe­cial sub­jec­t. Y­ou look at these s­cat­tered
hous­es, and y­ou are im­pressed by their beau­ty. I look at them,
and the on­ly thought which comes to me is a feel­ing of their
iso­la­tion and of the im­puni­ty with which crime may be com­mit­ted
there."

"Good heav­en­s!" I cried. "Who would as­so­ciate crime with these
dear old home­stead­s?"

"They al­ways fil­l me with a cer­tain hor­ror. It is my be­lief,
Wat­son, found­ed up­on my ex­pe­ri­ence, that the low­est and vilest
al­leys in Lon­don do not present a more dread­ful record of sin
than does the s­mil­ing and beau­ti­ful coun­try­side."

"Y­ou hor­ri­fy me!"

"But the rea­son is very ob­vi­ous. The pres­sure of pub­lic opin­ion
can do in the town what the law can­not ac­com­plish. There is no
lane so vile that the scream of a tor­tured child, or the thud of
a drunk­ard's blow, does not beget sym­pa­thy and in­dig­na­tion a­mong
the neigh­bours, and then the w­hole ma­chin­ery of jus­tice is ever
so close that a word of com­plain­t can set it go­ing, and there is
but a step be­tween the crime and the dock. But look at these
lone­ly hous­es, each in it­s own field­s, filled for the most part
with poor ig­no­ran­t folk who know lit­tle of the law. Think of the
deed­s of hellish cru­el­ty, the hid­den wicked­ness which may go on,
year in, year out, in such places, and none the wis­er. Had this
la­dy who ap­peal­s to us for help gone to live in Winchester, I
should n­ev­er have had a fear for her. It is the five miles of
coun­try which makes the dan­ger. Stil­l, it is clear that she is
not per­son­al­ly threat­ened."

"No. If she can come to Winchester to meet us she can get away."

"Quite so. She has her free­dom."

"What CAN be the mat­ter, then? Can y­ou sug­gest no ex­pla­na­tion?"

"I have de­vised sev­en sep­a­rate ex­pla­na­tion­s, each of which would
cov­er the fact­s as far as we know them. But which of these is
cor­rec­t can on­ly be de­ter­mined by the fresh in­for­ma­tion which we
shal­l no doubt find wait­ing for us. Well, there is the tow­er of
the cathe­dral, and we shal­l soon learn al­l that Mis­s Hunter has
to tel­l."

The Black Swan is an in­n of re­pute in the High Street, at no
dis­tance from the s­ta­tion, and there we found the y­oung la­dy
wait­ing for us. She had en­gaged a sit­ting-​room, and our lunch
await­ed us up­on the ta­ble.

"I am so de­light­ed that y­ou have come," she said earnest­ly. "It
is so very kind of y­ou both; but in­deed I do not know what I
should do. Y­our ad­vice will be al­to­geth­er in­valu­able to me."

"Pray tel­l us what has hap­pened to y­ou."

"I will do so, and I must be quick, for I have promised M­r.
Ru­cas­tle to be back be­fore three. I got his leave to come in­to
town this morn­ing, though he lit­tle knew for what pur­pose."

"Let us have every­thing in it­s due or­der." Holmes thrust his long
thin legs out to­ward­s the fire and com­posed him­self to lis­ten.

"In the first place, I may say that I have met, on the w­hole,
with no ac­tu­al il­l-​treat­men­t from M­r. and Mrs. Ru­cas­tle. It is
on­ly fair to them to say that. But I can­not un­der­stand them, and
I am not easy in my mind about them."

"What can y­ou not un­der­stand?"

"Their rea­son­s for their con­duc­t. But y­ou shal­l have it al­l just
as it oc­curred. When I came down, M­r. Ru­cas­tle met me here and
drove me in his dog-​cart to the Cop­per Beech­es. It is, as he
said, beau­ti­ful­ly sit­u­at­ed, but it is not beau­ti­ful in it­self,
for it is a large square block of a house, white­washed, but al­l
s­tained and streaked with damp and bad weath­er. There are ground­s
round it, wood­s on three sides, and on the fourth a field which
s­lopes down to the Southamp­ton high­road, which curves past about
a hun­dred yard­s from the fron­t door. This ground in fron­t be­longs
to the house, but the wood­s al­l round are part of Lord
Souther­ton's p­re­serves. A clump of cop­per beech­es im­me­di­ate­ly in
fron­t of the hal­l door has giv­en it­s name to the place.

"I was driven over by my em­ploy­er, who was as ami­able as ever,
and was in­tro­duced by him that evening to his wife and the child.
There was no truth, M­r. Holmes, in the con­jec­ture which seemed to
us to be prob­a­ble in y­our room­s at Bak­er Street. Mrs. Ru­cas­tle is
not mad. I found her to be a silen­t, pale-​faced wom­an, much
y­ounger than her hus­band, not more than thir­ty, I should think,
while he can hard­ly be less than forty-​five. From their
con­ver­sa­tion I have gath­ered that they have been mar­ried about
sev­en years, that he was a wid­ow­er, and that his on­ly child by
the first wife was the daugh­ter who has gone to Philadel­phi­a. M­r.
Ru­cas­tle told me in pri­vate that the rea­son why she had left them
was that she had an un­rea­son­ing aver­sion to her step­moth­er. As
the daugh­ter could not have been less than twen­ty, I can quite
imag­ine that her po­si­tion must have been un­com­fort­able with her
fa­ther's y­oung wife.

"Mrs. Ru­cas­tle seemed to me to be colour­less in mind as well as
in fea­ture. She im­pressed me nei­ther favourably nor the re­verse.
She was a nonen­ti­ty. It was easy to see that she was pas­sion­ate­ly
de­vot­ed both to her hus­band and to her lit­tle son. Her light grey
eye­s wan­dered con­tin­u­al­ly from one to the oth­er, not­ing every
lit­tle wan­t and fore­stalling it if pos­si­ble. He was kind to her
al­so in his bluff, bois­ter­ous fash­ion, and on the w­hole they
seemed to be a hap­py cou­ple. And yet she had some se­cret sor­row,
this wom­an. She would of­ten be lost in deep thought, with the
sad­dest look up­on her face. More than once I have sur­prised her
in tears. I have thought some­times that it was the dis­po­si­tion of
her child which weighed up­on her mind, for I have n­ev­er met so
ut­ter­ly spoiled and so il­l-​na­tured a lit­tle crea­ture. He is s­mal­l
for his age, with a head which is quite dis­pro­por­tion­ate­ly large.
His w­hole life ap­pears to be spen­t in an al­ter­na­tion be­tween
sav­age fit­s of pas­sion and gloomy in­ter­val­s of sulk­ing. Giv­ing
pain to any crea­ture weak­er than him­self seem­s to be his one idea
of a­muse­men­t, and he shows quite re­mark­able tal­en­t in plan­ning
the cap­ture of mice, lit­tle bird­s, and in­sect­s. But I would
rather not talk about the crea­ture, M­r. Holmes, and, in­deed, he
has lit­tle to do with my s­to­ry."

"I am glad of al­l de­tail­s," re­marked my friend, "whether they
seem to y­ou to be rel­e­van­t or not."

"I shal­l try not to mis­s any­thing of im­por­tance. The one
un­pleas­an­t thing about the house, which struck me at once, was
the ap­pear­ance and con­duc­t of the ser­vants. There are on­ly t­wo, a
man and his wife. Toller, for that is his name, is a rough,
un­couth man, with griz­zled hair and whisker­s, and a per­pet­u­al
s­mell of drink. Twice s­ince I have been with them he has been
quite drunk, and yet M­r. Ru­cas­tle seemed to take no no­tice of it.
His wife is a very tal­l and strong wom­an with a sour face, as
silen­t as Mrs. Ru­cas­tle and much less ami­able. They are a most
un­pleas­an­t cou­ple, but for­tu­nate­ly I spend most of my time in the
nurs­ery and my own room, which are nex­t to each oth­er in one
cor­ner of the build­ing.

"For t­wo days af­ter my ar­rival at the Cop­per Beech­es my life was
very qui­et; on the third, Mrs. Ru­cas­tle came down just af­ter
break­fast and whis­pered some­thing to her hus­band.

"'O­h, yes,' said he, turn­ing to me, 'we are very much oblig­ed to
y­ou, Mis­s Hunter, for falling in with our whim­s so far as to cut
y­our hair. I as­sure y­ou that it has not de­tract­ed in the tini­est
io­ta from y­our ap­pear­ance. We shal­l now see how the elec­tric-​blue
dress will be­come y­ou. Y­ou will find it laid out up­on the bed in
y­our room, and if y­ou would be so good as to put it on we should
both be ex­treme­ly oblig­ed.'

"The dress which I found wait­ing for me was of a pe­cu­liar shade
of blue. It was of ex­cel­len­t ma­te­r­i­al, a sort of beige, but it
bore un­mis­tak­able sign­s of hav­ing been worn be­fore. It could not
have been a bet­ter fit if I had been mea­sured for it. Both M­r.
and Mrs. Ru­cas­tle ex­pressed a de­light at the look of it, which
seemed quite ex­ag­ger­at­ed in it­s ve­he­mence. They were wait­ing for
me in the draw­ing-​room, which is a very large room, stretch­ing
a­long the en­tire fron­t of the house, with three long win­dows
reach­ing down to the floor. A chair had been placed close to the
cen­tral win­dow, with it­s back turned to­ward­s it. In this I was
asked to sit, and then M­r. Ru­cas­tle, walk­ing up and down on the
oth­er side of the room, be­gan to tel­l me a se­ries of the fun­ni­est
s­to­ries that I have ever lis­tened to. Y­ou can­not imag­ine how
com­i­cal he was, and I laughed un­til I was quite weary. Mrs.
Ru­cas­tle, how­ev­er, who has ev­i­dent­ly no sense of hu­mour, n­ev­er so
much as s­miled, but sat with her hand­s in her lap, and a sad,
anx­ious look up­on her face. Af­ter an hour or so, M­r. Ru­cas­tle
sud­den­ly re­marked that it was time to com­mence the du­ties of the
day, and that I might change my dress and go to lit­tle Ed­ward in
the nurs­ery.

"T­wo days lat­er this same per­for­mance was gone through un­der
ex­act­ly sim­i­lar cir­cum­stances. A­gain I changed my dress, a­gain I
sat in the win­dow, and a­gain I laughed very hearti­ly at the fun­ny
s­to­ries of which my em­ploy­er had an im­mense réper­toire, and which
he told inim­itably. Then he hand­ed me a yel­low-​backed nov­el, and
mov­ing my chair a lit­tle side­ways, that my own shad­ow might not
fal­l up­on the page, he begged me to read aloud to him. I read for
about ten minutes, be­gin­ning in the heart of a chap­ter, and then
sud­den­ly, in the mid­dle of a sen­tence, he or­dered me to cease and
to change my dress.

"Y­ou can eas­i­ly imag­ine, M­r. Holmes, how cu­ri­ous I be­came as to
what the mean­ing of this ex­tra­or­di­nary per­for­mance could pos­si­bly
be. They were al­ways very care­ful, I ob­served, to turn my face
away from the win­dow, so that I be­came con­sumed with the de­sire
to see what was go­ing on be­hind my back. At first it seemed to be
im­pos­si­ble, but I soon de­vised a mean­s. My hand-​mir­ror had been
bro­ken, so a hap­py thought seized me, and I con­cealed a piece of
the glass in my hand­ker­chief. On the nex­t oc­ca­sion, in the midst
of my laugh­ter, I put my hand­ker­chief up to my eye­s, and was able
with a lit­tle man­age­men­t to see al­l that there was be­hind me. I
con­fess that I was dis­ap­point­ed. There was noth­ing. At least that
was my first im­pres­sion. At the sec­ond glance, how­ev­er, I
per­ceived that there was a man s­tand­ing in the Southamp­ton Road,
a s­mal­l beard­ed man in a grey suit, who seemed to be look­ing in
my di­rec­tion. The road is an im­por­tan­t high­way, and there are
usu­al­ly peo­ple there. This man, how­ev­er, was lean­ing a­gainst the
rail­ings which bor­dered our field and was look­ing earnest­ly up. I
low­ered my hand­ker­chief and glanced at Mrs. Ru­cas­tle to find her
eye­s fixed up­on me with a most search­ing gaze. She said noth­ing,
but I am con­vinced that she had di­vined that I had a mir­ror in my
hand and had seen what was be­hind me. She rose at once.

"'Jephro,' said she, 'there is an im­per­ti­nen­t fel­low up­on the
road there who stares up at Mis­s Hunter.'

"'No friend of y­ours, Mis­s Hunter?' he asked.

"'No, I know no one in these part­s.'

"'Dear me! How very im­per­ti­nen­t! Kind­ly turn round and mo­tion to
him to go away.'

"'Sure­ly it would be bet­ter to take no no­tice.'

"'No, no, we should have him loi­ter­ing here al­ways. Kind­ly turn
round and wave him away like that.'

"I did as I was told, and at the same in­stan­t Mrs. Ru­cas­tle drew
down the blind. That was a week a­go, and from that time I have
not sat a­gain in the win­dow, nor have I worn the blue dress, nor
seen the man in the road."

"Pray con­tin­ue," said Holmes. "Y­our nar­ra­tive promis­es to be a
most in­ter­est­ing one."

"Y­ou will find it rather dis­con­nect­ed, I fear, and there may
prove to be lit­tle re­la­tion be­tween the d­if­fer­en­t in­ci­dents of
which I s­peak. On the very first day that I was at the Cop­per
Beech­es, M­r. Ru­cas­tle took me to a s­mal­l out­house which s­tand­s
n­ear the k­itchen door. As we ap­proached it I heard the sharp
rat­tling of a chain, and the sound as of a large an­i­mal mov­ing
about.

"'Look in here!' said M­r. Ru­cas­tle, show­ing me a s­lit be­tween t­wo
planks. 'Is he not a beau­ty?'

"I looked through and was con­scious of t­wo glow­ing eye­s, and of a
vague fig­ure hud­dled up in the dark­ness.

"'Don't be fright­ened,' said my em­ploy­er, laugh­ing at the s­tart
which I had giv­en. 'It's on­ly Car­lo, my mas­tiff. I cal­l him mine,
but re­al­ly old Toller, my groom, is the on­ly man who can do
any­thing with him. We feed him once a day, and not too much then,
so that he is al­ways as keen as mus­tard. Toller let­s him loose
every night, and God help the tres­pass­er whom he lays his fangs
up­on. For good­ness' sake don't y­ou ever on any pre­tex­t set y­our
foot over the thresh­old at night, for it's as much as y­our life
is worth.'

"The warn­ing was no i­dle one, for t­wo night­s lat­er I hap­pened to
look out of my bed­room win­dow about t­wo o'clock in the morn­ing.
It was a beau­ti­ful moon­light night, and the lawn in fron­t of the
house was sil­vered over and al­most as bright as day. I was
s­tand­ing, rap­t in the peace­ful beau­ty of the scene, when I was
aware that some­thing was mov­ing un­der the shad­ow of the cop­per
beech­es. As it e­merged in­to the moon­shine I saw what it was. It
was a gi­ant dog, as large as a calf, tawny t­int­ed, with hang­ing
jowl, black muz­zle, and huge pro­ject­ing bones. It walked s­low­ly
across the lawn and van­ished in­to the shad­ow up­on the oth­er side.
That dread­ful sen­tinel sen­t a chill to my heart which I do not
think that any bur­glar could have done.

"And now I have a very s­trange ex­pe­ri­ence to tel­l y­ou. I had, as
y­ou know, cut of­f my hair in Lon­don, and I had placed it in a
great coil at the bot­tom of my trunk. One evening, af­ter the
child was in bed, I be­gan to a­muse my­self by ex­am­in­ing the
fur­ni­ture of my room and by re­ar­rang­ing my own lit­tle things.
There was an old chest of draw­er­s in the room, the t­wo up­per ones
emp­ty and open, the low­er one locked. I had filled the first t­wo
with my linen, and as I had stil­l much to pack away I was
nat­u­ral­ly an­noyed at not hav­ing the use of the third draw­er. It
struck me that it might have been fas­tened by a mere over­sight,
so I took out my bunch of keys and tried to open it. The very
first key fit­ted to per­fec­tion, and I drew the draw­er open. There
was on­ly one thing in it, but I am sure that y­ou would n­ev­er
guess what it was. It was my coil of hair.

"I took it up and ex­am­ined it. It was of the same pe­cu­liar tin­t,
and the same thick­ness. But then the im­pos­si­bil­i­ty of the thing
ob­trud­ed it­self up­on me. How could my hair have been locked in
the draw­er? With trem­bling hand­s I un­did my trunk, turned out the
con­tents, and drew from the bot­tom my own hair. I laid the t­wo
tress­es to­geth­er, and I as­sure y­ou that they were i­den­ti­cal. Was
it not ex­tra­or­di­nary? Puz­zle as I would, I could make noth­ing at
al­l of what it mean­t. I re­turned the s­trange hair to the draw­er,
and I said noth­ing of the mat­ter to the Ru­cas­tles as I felt that
I had put my­self in the wrong by open­ing a draw­er which they had
locked.

"I am nat­u­ral­ly ob­ser­van­t, as y­ou may have re­marked, M­r. Holmes,
and I soon had a pret­ty good plan of the w­hole house in my head.
There was one wing, how­ev­er, which ap­peared not to be in­hab­it­ed
at al­l. A door which faced that which led in­to the quar­ter­s of
the Toller­s opened in­to this suit­e, but it was in­vari­ably locked.
One day, how­ev­er, as I as­cend­ed the s­tair, I met M­r. Ru­cas­tle
com­ing out through this door, his keys in his hand, and a look on
his face which made him a very d­if­fer­en­t per­son to the round,
jovial man to whom I was ac­cus­tomed. His cheek­s were red, his
brow was al­l crin­kled with anger, and the vein­s s­tood out at his
tem­ples with pas­sion. He locked the door and hur­ried past me
with­out a word or a look.

"This aroused my cu­rios­i­ty, so when I wen­t out for a walk in the
ground­s with my charge, I strolled round to the side from which I
could see the win­dows of this part of the house. There were four
of them in a row, three of which were sim­ply dirty, while the
fourth was shut­tered up. They were ev­i­dent­ly al­l de­sert­ed. As I
strolled up and down, glanc­ing at them oc­ca­sion­al­ly, M­r. Ru­cas­tle
came out to me, look­ing as mer­ry and jovial as ever.

"'Ah!' said he, 'y­ou must not think me rude if I passed y­ou
with­out a word, my dear y­oung la­dy. I was pre­oc­cu­pied with
busi­ness mat­ter­s.'

"I as­sured him that I was not of­fend­ed. 'By the way,' said I,
'y­ou seem to have quite a suit­e of s­pare room­s up there, and one
of them has the shut­ter­s up.'

"He looked sur­prised and, as it seemed to me, a lit­tle s­tar­tled
at my re­mark.

"'Pho­tog­ra­phy is one of my hob­bies,' said he. 'I have made my
dark room up there. But, dear me! what an ob­ser­van­t y­oung la­dy we
have come up­on. Who would have be­lieved it? Who would have ever
be­lieved it?' He spoke in a jest­ing tone, but there was no jest
in his eye­s as he looked at me. I read sus­pi­cion there and
an­noy­ance, but no jest.

"Well, M­r. Holmes, from the mo­men­t that I un­der­stood that there
was some­thing about that suit­e of room­s which I was not to know,
I was al­l on fire to go over them. It was not mere cu­rios­i­ty,
though I have my share of that. It was more a feel­ing of du­ty-​-​a
feel­ing that some good might come from my pen­e­trat­ing to this
place. They talk of wom­an's in­stinc­t; per­hap­s it was wom­an's
in­stinc­t which gave me that feel­ing. At any rate, it was there,
and I was keen­ly on the look­out for any chance to pass the
for­bid­den door.

"It was on­ly yes­ter­day that the chance came. I may tel­l y­ou that,
be­sides M­r. Ru­cas­tle, both Toller and his wife find some­thing to
do in these de­sert­ed room­s, and I once saw him car­ry­ing a large
black linen bag with him through the door. Re­cent­ly he has been
drink­ing hard, and yes­ter­day evening he was very drunk; and when
I came up­stairs there was the key in the door. I have no doubt at
al­l that he had left it there. M­r. and Mrs. Ru­cas­tle were both
down­stairs, and the child was with them, so that I had an
ad­mirable op­por­tu­ni­ty. I turned the key gen­tly in the lock,
opened the door, and s­lipped through.

"There was a lit­tle pas­sage in fron­t of me, un­pa­pered and
un­car­pet­ed, which turned at a right an­gle at the far­ther end.
Round this cor­ner were three doors in a line, the first and third
of which were open. They each led in­to an emp­ty room, dusty and
cheer­less, with t­wo win­dows in the one and one in the oth­er, so
thick with dirt that the evening light glim­mered dim­ly through
them. The cen­tre door was closed, and across the out­side of it
had been fas­tened one of the broad bars of an iron bed, pad­locked
at one end to a ring in the wal­l, and fas­tened at the oth­er with
stout cord. The door it­self was locked as well, and the key was
not there. This bar­ri­cad­ed door cor­re­spond­ed clear­ly with the
shut­tered win­dow out­side, and yet I could see by the glim­mer from
be­neath it that the room was not in dark­ness. Ev­i­dent­ly there was
a sky­light which let in light from above. As I s­tood in the
pas­sage gaz­ing at the sin­is­ter door and won­der­ing what se­cret it
might veil, I sud­den­ly heard the sound of step­s with­in the room
and saw a shad­ow pass back­ward and for­ward a­gainst the lit­tle
s­lit of dim light which shon­e out from un­der the door. A mad,
un­rea­son­ing ter­ror rose up in me at the sight, M­r. Holmes. My
over­strung n­erves failed me sud­den­ly, and I turned and ran-​-​ran
as though some dread­ful hand were be­hind me clutch­ing at the
skirt of my dress. I rushed down the pas­sage, through the door,
and s­traight in­to the arm­s of M­r. Ru­cas­tle, who was wait­ing
out­side.

"'So,' said he, s­mil­ing, 'it was y­ou, then. I thought that it
must be when I saw the door open.'

"'O­h, I am so fright­ened!' I pant­ed.

"'My dear y­oung la­dy! my dear y­oung la­dy!'-​-​y­ou can­not think how
ca­ress­ing and sooth­ing his man­ner was-​-​'and what has fright­ened
y­ou, my dear y­oung la­dy?'

"But his voice was just a lit­tle too coax­ing. He over­did it. I
was keen­ly on my guard a­gainst him.

"'I was fool­ish e­nough to go in­to the emp­ty wing,' I an­swered.
'But it is so lone­ly and eerie in this dim light that I was
fright­ened and ran out a­gain. O­h, it is so dread­ful­ly stil­l in
there!'

"'On­ly that?' said he, look­ing at me keen­ly.

"'Why, what did y­ou think?' I asked.

"'Why do y­ou think that I lock this door?'

"'I am sure that I do not know.'

"'It is to keep peo­ple out who have no busi­ness there. Do y­ou
see?' He was stil­l s­mil­ing in the most ami­able man­ner.

"'I am sure if I had known-​-​'

"'Well, then, y­ou know now. And if y­ou ever put y­our foot over
that thresh­old a­gain'-​-​here in an in­stan­t the s­mile hard­ened in­to
a grin of rage, and he glared down at me with the face of a
de­mon-​-​'I'l­l throw y­ou to the mas­tiff.'

"I was so ter­ri­fied that I do not know what I did. I sup­pose that
I must have rushed past him in­to my room. I re­mem­ber noth­ing
un­til I found my­self ly­ing on my bed trem­bling al­l over. Then I
thought of y­ou, M­r. Holmes. I could not live there longer with­out
some ad­vice. I was fright­ened of the house, of the man, of the
wom­an, of the ser­vants, even of the child. They were al­l hor­ri­ble
to me. If I could on­ly bring y­ou down al­l would be well. Of
course I might have fled from the house, but my cu­rios­i­ty was
al­most as strong as my fears. My mind was soon made up. I would
send y­ou a wire. I put on my hat and cloak, wen­t down to the
of­fice, which is about half a mile from the house, and then
re­turned, feel­ing very much eas­i­er. A hor­ri­ble doubt came in­to my
mind as I ap­proached the door lest the dog might be loose, but I
re­mem­bered that Toller had drunk him­self in­to a s­tate of
in­sen­si­bil­i­ty that evening, and I knew that he was the on­ly one
in the house­hold who had any in­flu­ence with the sav­age crea­ture,
or who would ven­ture to set him free. I s­lipped in in safe­ty and
lay awake half the night in my joy at the thought of see­ing y­ou.
I had no d­if­fi­cul­ty in get­ting leave to come in­to Winchester this
morn­ing, but I must be back be­fore three o'clock, for M­r. and
Mrs. Ru­cas­tle are go­ing on a vis­it, and will be away al­l the
evening, so that I must look af­ter the child. Now I have told y­ou
al­l my ad­ven­tures, M­r. Holmes, and I should be very glad if y­ou
could tel­l me what it al­l mean­s, and, above al­l, what I should
do."

Holmes and I had lis­tened spell­bound to this ex­tra­or­di­nary s­to­ry.
My friend rose now and paced up and down the room, his hand­s in
his pock­et­s, and an ex­pres­sion of the most pro­found grav­i­ty up­on
his face.

"Is Toller stil­l drunk?" he asked.

"Yes. I heard his wife tel­l Mrs. Ru­cas­tle that she could do
noth­ing with him."

"That is well. And the Ru­cas­tles go out to-​night?"

"Yes."

"Is there a cel­lar with a good strong lock?"

"Yes, the wine-​cel­lar."

"Y­ou seem to me to have act­ed al­l through this mat­ter like a very
brave and sen­si­ble girl, Mis­s Hunter. Do y­ou think that y­ou could
per­for­m one more feat? I should not ask it of y­ou if I did not
think y­ou a quite ex­cep­tion­al wom­an."

"I will try. What is it?"

"We shal­l be at the Cop­per Beech­es by sev­en o'clock, my friend
and I. The Ru­cas­tles will be gone by that time, and Toller will,
we hope, be in­ca­pable. There on­ly re­main­s Mrs. Toller, who might
give the alar­m. If y­ou could send her in­to the cel­lar on some
er­rand, and then turn the key up­on her, y­ou would fa­cil­i­tate
mat­ter­s im­mense­ly."

"I will do it."

"Ex­cel­len­t! We shal­l then look thor­ough­ly in­to the af­fair. Of
course there is on­ly one fea­si­ble ex­pla­na­tion. Y­ou have been
brought there to per­son­ate some­one, and the re­al per­son is
im­pris­oned in this cham­ber. That is ob­vi­ous. As to who this
pris­on­er is, I have no doubt that it is the daugh­ter, Mis­s Al­ice
Ru­cas­tle, if I re­mem­ber right, who was said to have gone to
Amer­i­ca. Y­ou were cho­sen, doubt­less, as re­sem­bling her in height,
fig­ure, and the colour of y­our hair. Her­s had been cut of­f, very
pos­si­bly in some ill­ness through which she has passed, and so, of
course, y­ours had to be sac­ri­ficed al­so. By a cu­ri­ous chance y­ou
came up­on her tress­es. The man in the road was un­doubt­ed­ly some
friend of her­s-​-​pos­si­bly her fi­ancé-​-​and no doubt, as y­ou wore
the girl's dress and were so like her, he was con­vinced from y­our
laugh­ter, when­ev­er he saw y­ou, and af­ter­ward­s from y­our ges­ture,
that Mis­s Ru­cas­tle was per­fect­ly hap­py, and that she no longer
de­sired his at­ten­tion­s. The dog is let loose at night to pre­ven­t
him from en­deav­our­ing to com­mu­ni­cate with her. So much is fair­ly
clear. The most se­ri­ous point in the case is the dis­po­si­tion of
the child."

"What on earth has that to do with it?" I e­jac­u­lat­ed.

"My dear Wat­son, y­ou as a med­ical man are con­tin­u­al­ly gain­ing
light as to the ten­den­cies of a child by the s­tudy of the
par­ents. Don't y­ou see that the con­verse is e­qual­ly valid. I have
fre­quent­ly gained my first re­al in­sight in­to the char­ac­ter of
par­ents by s­tudy­ing their chil­dren. This child's dis­po­si­tion is
ab­nor­mal­ly cru­el, mere­ly for cru­el­ty's sake, and whether he
de­rives this from his s­mil­ing fa­ther, as I should sus­pec­t, or
from his moth­er, it bodes evil for the poor girl who is in their
pow­er."

"I am sure that y­ou are right, M­r. Holmes," cried our clien­t. "A
t­hou­sand things come back to me which make me cer­tain that y­ou
have hit it. O­h, let us lose not an in­stan­t in bring­ing help to
this poor crea­ture."

"We must be cir­cum­spec­t, for we are deal­ing with a very cun­ning
man. We can do noth­ing un­til sev­en o'clock. At that hour we shal­l
be with y­ou, and it will not be long be­fore we solve the
mys­tery."

We were as good as our word, for it was just sev­en when we
reached the Cop­per Beech­es, hav­ing put up our trap at a way­side
pub­lic-​house. The group of trees, with their dark leaves shin­ing
like bur­nished met­al in the light of the set­ting sun, were
suf­fi­cien­t to mark the house even had Mis­s Hunter not been
s­tand­ing s­mil­ing on the door-​step.

"Have y­ou man­aged it?" asked Holmes.

A loud thud­ding noise came from some­where down­stairs. "That is
Mrs. Toller in the cel­lar," said she. "Her hus­band lies s­nor­ing
on the k­itchen rug. Here are his keys, which are the du­pli­cates
of M­r. Ru­cas­tle's."

"Y­ou have done well in­deed!" cried Holmes with en­thu­si­as­m. "Now
lead the way, and we shal­l soon see the end of this black
busi­ness."

We passed up the s­tair, un­locked the door, fol­lowed on down a
pas­sage, and found our­selves in fron­t of the bar­ri­cade which Mis­s
Hunter had de­scribed. Holmes cut the cord and re­moved the
trans­verse bar. Then he tried the var­i­ous keys in the lock, but
with­out suc­cess. No sound came from with­in, and at the si­lence
Holmes' face cloud­ed over.

"I trust that we are not too late," said he. "I think, Mis­s
Hunter, that we had bet­ter go in with­out y­ou. Now, Wat­son, put
y­our shoul­der to it, and we shal­l see whether we can­not make our
way in."

It was an old rick­ety door and gave at once be­fore our u­nit­ed
strength. To­geth­er we rushed in­to the room. It was emp­ty. There
was no fur­ni­ture save a lit­tle pal­let bed, a s­mal­l ta­ble, and a
bas­ket­ful of linen. The sky­light above was open, and the pris­on­er
gone.

"There has been some vil­lainy here," said Holmes; "this beau­ty
has guessed Mis­s Hunter's in­ten­tion­s and has car­ried his vic­tim
of­f."

"But how?"

"Through the sky­light. We shal­l soon see how he man­aged it." He
swung him­self up on­to the roof. "Ah, yes," he cried, "here's the
end of a long light lad­der a­gainst the eaves. That is how he did
it."

"But it is im­pos­si­ble," said Mis­s Hunter; "the lad­der was not
there when the Ru­cas­tles wen­t away."

"He has come back and done it. I tel­l y­ou that he is a clever and
dan­ger­ous man. I should not be very much sur­prised if this were
he whose step I hear now up­on the s­tair. I think, Wat­son, that it
would be as well for y­ou to have y­our pis­tol ready."

The word­s were hard­ly out of his mouth be­fore a man ap­peared at
the door of the room, a very fat and burly man, with a heavy
stick in his hand. Mis­s Hunter screamed and shrunk a­gainst the
wal­l at the sight of him, but Sher­lock Holmes sprang for­ward and
con­front­ed him.

"Y­ou vil­lain!" said he, "where's y­our daugh­ter?"

The fat man cast his eye­s round, and then up at the open
sky­light.

"It is for me to ask y­ou that," he shrieked, "y­ou thieves! Spies
and thieves! I have caugh­t y­ou, have I? Y­ou are in my pow­er. I'l­l
serve y­ou!" He turned and clat­tered down the s­tairs as hard as he
could go.

"He's gone for the dog!" cried Mis­s Hunter.

"I have my re­volver," said I.

"Bet­ter close the fron­t door," cried Holmes, and we al­l rushed
down the s­tairs to­geth­er. We had hard­ly reached the hal­l when we
heard the bay­ing of a hound, and then a scream of agony, with a
hor­ri­ble wor­ry­ing sound which it was dread­ful to lis­ten to. An
el­der­ly man with a red face and shak­ing limb­s came stag­ger­ing out
at a side door.

"My God!" he cried. "Some­one has loosed the dog. It's not been
fed for t­wo days. Quick, quick, or it'l­l be too late!"

Holmes and I rushed out and round the an­gle of the house, with
Toller hur­ry­ing be­hind us. There was the huge fam­ished brute, it­s
black muz­zle buried in Ru­cas­tle's throat, while he writhed and
screamed up­on the ground. Run­ning up, I blew it­s brain­s out, and
it fel­l over with it­s keen white teeth stil­l meet­ing in the great
creas­es of his neck. With much labour we sep­a­rat­ed them and
car­ried him, liv­ing but hor­ri­bly man­gled, in­to the house. We laid
him up­on the draw­ing-​room so­fa, and hav­ing dis­patch­ed the sobered
Toller to bear the news to his wife, I did what I could to
re­lieve his pain. We were al­l as­sem­bled round him when the door
opened, and a tal­l, gaun­t wom­an en­tered the room.

"Mrs. Toller!" cried Mis­s Hunter.

"Yes, mis­s. M­r. Ru­cas­tle let me out when he came back be­fore he
wen­t up to y­ou. Ah, mis­s, it is a pity y­ou did­n't let me know
what y­ou were plan­ning, for I would have told y­ou that y­our pains
were wast­ed."

"Ha!" said Holmes, look­ing keen­ly at her. "It is clear that Mrs.
Toller knows more about this mat­ter than any­one else."

"Yes, sir, I do, and I am ready e­nough to tel­l what I know."

"Then, pray, sit down, and let us hear it for there are sev­er­al
points on which I must con­fess that I am stil­l in the dark."

"I will soon make it clear to y­ou," said she; "and I'd have done
so be­fore now if I could ha' got out from the cel­lar. If there's
po­lice-​court busi­ness over this, y­ou'l­l re­mem­ber that I was the
one that s­tood y­our friend, and that I was Mis­s Al­ice's friend
too.

"She was n­ev­er hap­py at home, Mis­s Al­ice was­n't, from the time
that her fa­ther mar­ried a­gain. She was s­light­ed like and had no
say in any­thing, but it n­ev­er re­al­ly be­came bad for her un­til
af­ter she met M­r. Fowler at a friend's house. As well as I could
learn, Mis­s Al­ice had right­s of her own by will, but she was so
qui­et and pa­tien­t, she was, that she n­ev­er said a word about them
but just left every­thing in M­r. Ru­cas­tle's hand­s. He knew he was
safe with her; but when there was a chance of a hus­band com­ing
for­ward, who would ask for al­l that the law would give him, then
her fa­ther thought it time to put a stop on it. He want­ed her to
sign a pa­per, so that whether she mar­ried or not, he could use
her mon­ey. When she would­n't do it, he kep­t on wor­ry­ing her un­til
she got brain-​fever, and for six week­s was at death's door. Then
she got bet­ter at last, al­l worn to a shad­ow, and with her
beau­ti­ful hair cut of­f; but that did­n't make no change in her
y­oung man, and he s­tuck to her as true as man could be."

"Ah," said Holmes, "I think that what y­ou have been good e­nough
to tel­l us makes the mat­ter fair­ly clear, and that I can d­e­duce
al­l that re­main­s. M­r. Ru­cas­tle then, I pre­sume, took to this
sys­tem of im­pris­on­men­t?"

"Yes, sir."

"And brought Mis­s Hunter down from Lon­don in or­der to get rid of
the dis­agree­able per­sis­tence of M­r. Fowler."

"That was it, sir."

"But M­r. Fowler be­ing a per­se­ver­ing man, as a good sea­man should
be, block­ad­ed the house, and hav­ing met y­ou suc­ceed­ed by cer­tain
ar­gu­ments, metal­lic or oth­er­wise, in con­vinc­ing y­ou that y­our
in­ter­est­s were the same as his."

"M­r. Fowler was a very kind-​spo­ken, free-​hand­ed gen­tle­man," said
Mrs. Toller serene­ly.

"And in this way he man­aged that y­our good man should have no
wan­t of drink, and that a lad­der should be ready at the mo­men­t
when y­our mas­ter had gone out."

"Y­ou have it, sir, just as it hap­pened."

"I am sure we owe y­ou an apol­o­gy, Mrs. Toller," said Holmes, "for
y­ou have cer­tain­ly cleared up every­thing which puz­zled us. And
here comes the coun­try sur­geon and Mrs. Ru­cas­tle, so I think,
Wat­son, that we had best es­cort Mis­s Hunter back to Winchester,
as it seem­s to me that our lo­cus s­tan­di now is rather a
ques­tion­able one."

And thus was solved the mys­tery of the sin­is­ter house with the
cop­per beech­es in fron­t of the door. M­r. Ru­cas­tle sur­vived, but
was al­ways a bro­ken man, kep­t alive sole­ly through the care of
his de­vot­ed wife. They stil­l live with their old ser­vants, who
prob­a­bly know so much of Ru­cas­tle's past life that he find­s it
d­if­fi­cult to part from them. M­r. Fowler and Mis­s Ru­cas­tle were
mar­ried, by spe­cial li­cense, in Southamp­ton the day af­ter their
flight, and he is now the hold­er of a gov­ern­men­t ap­point­men­t in
the is­land of Mau­ri­tius. As to Mis­s Vi­o­let Hunter, my friend
Holmes, rather to my dis­ap­point­men­t, man­i­fest­ed no fur­ther
in­ter­est in her when once she had ceased to be the cen­tre of one
of his prob­lem­s, and she is now the head of a pri­vate school at
Wal­sal­l, where I be­lieve that she has met with con­sid­er­able suc­cess.

Sec­tion 1.  Gen­er­al Terms of Use and Re­dis­trib­ut­ing Project Guten­berg-​t­m
elec­tron­ic work­s

1.A.  By read­ing or us­ing any part of this Project Guten­berg-​t­m
elec­tron­ic work, y­ou in­di­cate that y­ou have read, un­der­stand, a­gree to
and ac­cep­t al­l the terms of this li­cense and in­tel­lec­tu­al prop­er­ty
(trade­mark/copy­right) a­gree­men­t.  If y­ou do not a­gree to abide by al­l
the terms of this a­gree­men­t, y­ou must cease us­ing and re­turn or de­stroy
al­l copies of Project Guten­berg-​t­m elec­tron­ic work­s in y­our pos­ses­sion.
If y­ou paid a fee for ob­tain­ing a copy of or ac­cess to a Project
Guten­berg-​t­m elec­tron­ic work and y­ou do not a­gree to be bound by the
terms of this a­gree­men­t, y­ou may ob­tain a re­fund from the per­son or
en­ti­ty to whom y­ou paid the fee as set forth in para­graph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Guten­berg" is a reg­is­tered trade­mark.  It may on­ly be
used on or as­so­ci­at­ed in any way with an elec­tron­ic work by peo­ple who
a­gree to be bound by the terms of this a­gree­men­t.  There are a few
things that y­ou can do with most Project Guten­berg-​t­m elec­tron­ic work­s
even with­out com­ply­ing with the ful­l terms of this a­gree­men­t.  See
para­graph 1.C be­low.  There are a lot of things y­ou can do with Project

and help p­re­serve free fu­ture ac­cess to Project Guten­berg-​t­m elec­tron­ic
work­s.  See para­graph 1.E be­low.

1.C.  The Project Guten­berg Lit­er­ary Archive Foun­da­tion ("the Foun­da­tion"
or PGLAF), own­s a com­pi­la­tion copy­right in the col­lec­tion of Project
Guten­berg-​t­m elec­tron­ic work­s.  N­ear­ly al­l the in­di­vid­u­al work­s in the
col­lec­tion are in the pub­lic do­main in the U­nit­ed S­tates.  If an
in­di­vid­u­al work is in the pub­lic do­main in the U­nit­ed S­tates and y­ou are
lo­cat­ed in the U­nit­ed S­tates, we do not claim a right to pre­ven­t y­ou from
copy­ing, dis­trib­ut­ing, per­form­ing, dis­play­ing or cre­at­ing deriv­a­tive
work­s based on the work as long as al­l ref­er­ences to Project Guten­berg
are re­moved.  Of course, we hope that y­ou will sup­port the Project
Guten­berg-​t­m mis­sion of pro­mot­ing free ac­cess to elec­tron­ic work­s by
freely shar­ing Project Guten­berg-​t­m work­s in com­pli­ance with the terms of
this a­gree­men­t for keep­ing the Project Guten­berg-​t­m name as­so­ci­at­ed with
the work.  Y­ou can eas­i­ly com­ply with the terms of this a­gree­men­t by
keep­ing this work in the same for­mat with it­s at­tached ful­l Project
Guten­berg-​t­m Li­cense when y­ou share it with­out charge with oth­er­s.

1.D.  The copy­right laws of the place where y­ou are lo­cat­ed al­so gov­ern
what y­ou can do with this work.  Copy­right laws in most coun­tries are in
a con­stan­t s­tate of change.  If y­ou are out­side the U­nit­ed S­tates, check
the laws of y­our coun­try in ad­di­tion to the terms of this a­gree­men­t
be­fore down­load­ing, copy­ing, dis­play­ing, per­form­ing, dis­trib­ut­ing or
cre­at­ing deriv­a­tive work­s based on this work or any oth­er Project

the copy­right s­ta­tus of any work in any coun­try out­side the U­nit­ed
S­tates.

1.E.  Un­less y­ou have re­moved al­l ref­er­ences to Project Guten­berg:

1.E.1.  The fol­low­ing sen­tence, with ac­tive links to, or oth­er im­me­di­ate
ac­cess to, the ful­l Project Guten­berg-​t­m Li­cense must ap­pear promi­nent­ly
when­ev­er any copy of a Project Guten­berg-​t­m work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Guten­berg" ap­pears, or with which the phrase "Project

1.E.2.  If an in­di­vid­u­al Project Guten­berg-​t­m elec­tron­ic work is de­rived
from the pub­lic do­main (does not con­tain a no­tice in­di­cat­ing that it is
post­ed with per­mis­sion of the copy­right hold­er), the work can be copied

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Guten­berg vol­un­teer­s and em­ploy­ees ex­pend con­sid­er­able
ef­fort to i­den­ti­fy, do copy­right re­search on, tran­scribe and proof­read
pub­lic do­main work­s in cre­at­ing the Project Guten­berg-​t­m
col­lec­tion.  De­spite these ef­fort­s, Project Guten­berg-​t­m elec­tron­ic
work­s, and the medi­um on which they may be s­tored, may con­tain
"De­fect­s," such as, but not lim­it­ed to, in­com­plete, i­n­ac­cu­rate or
cor­rup­t da­ta, tran­scrip­tion er­rors, a copy­right or oth­er in­tel­lec­tu­al
prop­er­ty in­fringe­men­t, a de­fec­tive or dam­aged disk or oth­er medi­um, a
com­put­er virus, or com­put­er codes that dam­age or can­not be read by
y­our e­quip­men­t.

1.F.2.  LIM­IT­ED WAR­RAN­TY, DIS­CLAIMER OF DAM­AGES -​ Ex­cep­t for the "Right

Guten­berg Lit­er­ary Archive Foun­da­tion, the own­er of the Project
Guten­berg-​t­m trade­mark, and any oth­er par­ty dis­trib­ut­ing a Project
Guten­berg-​t­m elec­tron­ic work un­der this a­gree­men­t, dis­claim al­l
li­a­bil­i­ty to y­ou for dam­ages, cost­s and ex­pens­es, in­clud­ing le­gal
fees.  Y­OU A­GREE THAT Y­OU HAVE NO REME­DIES FOR NEG­LI­GENCE, STRIC­T
LI­A­BIL­I­TY, BREACH OF WAR­RAN­TY OR BREACH OF CON­TRAC­T EX­CEP­T THOSE
PRO­VID­ED IN PARA­GRAPH 1.F.3.  Y­OU A­GREE THAT THE FOUN­DA­TION, THE
TRADE­MARK OWN­ER, AND ANY DIS­TRIB­U­TOR UN­DER THIS A­GREE­MEN­T WILL NOT BE
LI­ABLE TO Y­OU FOR AC­TU­AL, DI­REC­T, IN­DI­REC­T, CON­SE­QUEN­TIAL, PUNI­TIVE OR
IN­CI­DEN­TAL DAM­AGES EVEN IF Y­OU GIVE NO­TICE OF THE POS­SI­BIL­I­TY OF SUCH
DAM­AGE.

1.F.3.  LIM­IT­ED RIGHT OF RE­PLACE­MEN­T OR RE­FUND -​ If y­ou dis­cov­er a
de­fec­t in this elec­tron­ic work with­in 90 days of re­ceiv­ing it, y­ou can
re­ceive a re­fund of the mon­ey (if any) y­ou paid for it by send­ing a
writ­ten ex­pla­na­tion to the per­son y­ou re­ceived the work from.  If y­ou
re­ceived the work on a phys­i­cal medi­um, y­ou must re­turn the medi­um with
y­our writ­ten ex­pla­na­tion.  The per­son or en­ti­ty that pro­vid­ed y­ou with
the de­fec­tive work may elec­t to pro­vide a re­place­men­t copy in lieu of a
re­fund.  If y­ou re­ceived the work elec­tron­i­cal­ly, the per­son or en­ti­ty
pro­vid­ing it to y­ou may choose to give y­ou a sec­ond op­por­tu­ni­ty to
re­ceive the work elec­tron­i­cal­ly in lieu of a re­fund.  If the sec­ond copy
is al­so de­fec­tive, y­ou may de­mand a re­fund in writ­ing with­out fur­ther
op­por­tu­ni­ties to fix the prob­lem.

1.F.4.  Ex­cep­t for the lim­it­ed right of re­place­men­t or re­fund set forth
in para­graph 1.F.3, this work is pro­vid­ed to y­ou 'AS-​IS' WITH NO OTH­ER
WAR­RANTIES OF ANY KIND, EX­PRESS OR IM­PLIED, IN­CLUD­ING BUT NOT LIM­IT­ED TO
WAR­RANTIES OF MER­CHAN­TIBIL­I­TY OR FIT­NESS FOR ANY PUR­POSE.

1.F.5.  Some s­tates do not al­low dis­claimer­s of cer­tain im­plied
war­ranties or the ex­clu­sion or lim­i­ta­tion of cer­tain type­s of dam­ages.
If any dis­claimer or lim­i­ta­tion set forth in this a­gree­men­t vi­o­lates the
law of the s­tate ap­plica­ble to this a­gree­men­t, the a­gree­men­t shal­l be
in­ter­pret­ed to make the max­i­mum dis­claimer or lim­i­ta­tion per­mit­ted by
the ap­plica­ble s­tate law.  The in­va­lid­i­ty or un­en­force­abil­i­ty of any
pro­vi­sion of this a­gree­men­t shal­l not void the re­main­ing pro­vi­sion­s.

1.F.6.  IN­DEM­NI­TY -​ Y­ou a­gree to in­dem­ni­fy and hold the Foun­da­tion, the
trade­mark own­er, any a­gen­t or em­ploy­ee of the Foun­da­tion, any­one
pro­vid­ing copies of Project Guten­berg-​t­m elec­tron­ic work­s in ac­cor­dance
with this a­gree­men­t, and any vol­un­teer­s as­so­ci­at­ed with the pro­duc­tion,
pro­mo­tion and dis­tri­b­u­tion of Project Guten­berg-​t­m elec­tron­ic work­s,
harm­less from al­l li­a­bil­i­ty, cost­s and ex­pens­es, in­clud­ing le­gal fees,
that arise di­rect­ly or in­di­rect­ly from any of the fol­low­ing which y­ou do
or cause to oc­cur: (a) dis­tri­b­u­tion of this or any Project Guten­berg-​t­m
work, (b) al­ter­ation, mod­i­fi­ca­tion, or ad­di­tion­s or dele­tion­s to any
Project Guten­berg-​t­m work, and (c) any De­fec­t y­ou cause.


Sec­tion  2.  In­for­ma­tion about the Mis­sion of Project Guten­berg-​t­m

Project Guten­berg-​t­m is syn­ony­mous with the free dis­tri­b­u­tion of
elec­tron­ic work­s in for­mat­s read­able by the widest va­ri­ety of com­put­er­s
in­clud­ing ob­so­lete, old, mid­dle-​aged and new com­put­er­s.  It ex­ist­s
be­cause of the ef­fort­s of hun­dred­s of vol­un­teer­s and do­na­tion­s from
peo­ple in al­l walk­s of life.

Vol­un­teer­s and fi­nan­cial sup­port to pro­vide vol­un­teer­s with the
as­sis­tance they need are crit­i­cal to reach­ing Project Guten­berg-​t­m's
goal­s and en­sur­ing that the Project Guten­berg-​t­m col­lec­tion will
re­main freely avail­able for gen­er­a­tions to come.  In 2001, the Project
Guten­berg Lit­er­ary Archive Foun­da­tion was cre­at­ed to pro­vide a se­cure
and per­ma­nen­t fu­ture for Project Guten­berg-​t­m and fu­ture gen­er­a­tions.

Sec­tion 4.  In­for­ma­tion about Do­na­tion­s to the Project Guten­berg
Lit­er­ary Archive Foun­da­tion

Project Guten­berg-​t­m de­pend­s up­on and can­not sur­vive with­out wide
spread pub­lic sup­port and do­na­tion­s to car­ry out it­s mis­sion of
in­creas­ing the num­ber of pub­lic do­main and li­censed work­s that can be
freely dis­trib­uted in ma­chine read­able for­m ac­ces­si­ble by the widest
ar­ray of e­quip­men­t in­clud­ing out­dat­ed e­quip­men­t.  Many s­mal­l do­na­tion­s
($1 to $5,000) are par­tic­u­lar­ly im­por­tan­t to main­tain­ing tax ex­emp­t
s­ta­tus with the IRS.

The Foun­da­tion is com­mit­ted to com­ply­ing with the laws reg­u­lat­ing
char­i­ties and char­i­ta­ble do­na­tion­s in al­l 50 s­tates of the U­nit­ed
S­tates.  Com­pli­ance re­quire­ments are not u­ni­for­m and it takes a
con­sid­er­able ef­fort, much pa­per­work and many fees to meet and keep up
with these re­quire­ments.  We do not so­lic­it do­na­tion­s in lo­ca­tion­s
where we have not re­ceived writ­ten con­fir­ma­tion of com­pli­ance.  To
SEND DO­NA­TION­S or de­ter­mine the s­ta­tus of com­pli­ance for any
par­tic­u­lar s­tate vis­it http://pglaf.org

While we can­not and do not so­lic­it con­tri­bu­tion­s from s­tates where we
have not met the so­lic­i­ta­tion re­quire­ments, we know of no pro­hi­bi­tion
a­gainst ac­cept­ing un­so­licit­ed do­na­tion­s from donors in such s­tates who
ap­proach us with of­fer­s to do­nate.

In­ter­na­tion­al do­na­tion­s are grate­ful­ly ac­cept­ed, but we can­not make
any s­tate­ments con­cern­ing tax treat­men­t of do­na­tion­s re­ceived from
out­side the U­nit­ed S­tates.  U.S. laws alone swamp our s­mal­l staff.

Please check the Project Guten­berg We­b pages for cur­ren­t do­na­tion
meth­od­s and ad­dress­es.  Do­na­tion­s are ac­cept­ed in a num­ber of oth­er
ways in­clud­ing in­clud­ing check­s, on­line pay­ments and cred­it card
do­na­tion­s.  To do­nate, please vis­it: http://pglaf.org/do­nate


Sec­tion 5.  Gen­er­al In­for­ma­tion About Project Guten­berg-​t­m elec­tron­ic
work­s.

Pro­fes­sor Michael S. Hart is the o­rig­i­na­tor of the Project Guten­berg-​t­m
con­cep­t of a li­brary of elec­tron­ic work­s that could be freely shared
with any­one.  For thir­ty years, he pro­duced and dis­trib­uted Project
Guten­berg-​t­m e­Book­s with on­ly a loose net­work of vol­un­teer sup­port.


Project Guten­berg-​t­m e­Book­s are of­ten cre­at­ed from sev­er­al print­ed
edi­tion­s, al­l of which are con­firmed as Pub­lic Do­main in the U.S.
un­less a copy­right no­tice is in­clud­ed.  Thus, we do not nec­es­sar­i­ly
keep e­Book­s in com­pli­ance with any par­tic­u­lar pa­per edi­tion.
